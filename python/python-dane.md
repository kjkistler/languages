# Python

in this course I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know to get started programming in Python 

now python is one of the most popular programming languages out there and it's by far one of the most sought-after for jobs

and so if you're trying to get a job or you're trying to you know automate your life or you're trying to write awesome scripts to do a bunch of different things then pythons for you 

honestly more and more developers everyday are moving their projects over to Python because it's such a powerful and it's such an easy to use language 

a lot of programming languages out there just aren't very beginner friendly 

there's a lot of syntax there's a lot of like little things that if you get wrong the program will yell at you 

Python is the complete opposite of that 

you basically just type out what you want to do and Python does it 

it's that simple 

there's not a whole lot of syntax to learn 

the learning curve is literally zero 

you jump in you can start writing your first program in seconds 

in this course I'm gonna teach you guys everything you need to know to get started in Python 

I designed this course especially for Python and each lesson has been specially designed with examples that will help you along the way 

with so many people starting to learn Python the question isn't why should you learn Python the question is why shouldn't you 

and I think for a lot of people the reason they might not want to learn Python is because they're intimidated or they're afraid that it's gonna be too hard 

trust me I am going to hold your hand through this entire course 

we're gonna talk about all the core concepts in Python 

we're gonna look at everything you need to know to start programming in Python and start being confident and start writing scripts and start writing programs that are awesome and doing cool things in your life 

anyway I'm super pumped to be teaching you guys Python 

I can't wait to get started in this course and I hope you guys stick around and follow along with the course and learn this amazing programming language



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to install Python onto your computer and we're also going to install a text editor that we can use to write our Python programs in so the first order of business is to actually install Python on your computer so what we want to do is head over to our web browser and you want to go over here to this page it's just ww python org /downloads and on this page there's going to be two buttons down here and it's gonna say download Python three point six point three and at least up to the version that I have right now or download Python 2.7 point one four so here's the thing about Python there's actually two major versions of Python that are in use currently there's Python - and there's Python 30 so you can see over here this is like two point seven point one for basically any Python - version we would just refer to as like Python - and here's like the latest Python 3 version and so there's these two versions that you can download and the first thing we have to decide is which version do we want to download and here's the basic difference Python 2 is a legacy version of Python which basically means that it's like an old version and it's not being like actively maintained or supported like officially by Python anymore Python 3 is like the future of Python it's like the newest version it's the one that's getting actively maintained and supported and so there's pros and cons to picking either one a lot of people will say like Python 2 has been around longer and so there's more like libraries there's basically just more Python code written in Python 2 so therefore like there's a few more things that you can do in Python 2 then you can do in Python 3 but then again Python 2 is not supported and you know five or ten years from now probably no one's gonna be using it Python 3 like I said is like the future of Python it's the newest version it's the one that you know is sort of being maintained going forward so for the purposes of this tutorial I'm gonna be teaching you guys Python 3 so we're gonna want to download pi three now here's a thing like if you learned Python three or you learn Python two the differences aren't very big there are a few differences in like some syntax and just some you know little things here and there but if you learn Python three you'll be able to jump right in and code in Python two as well don't let anyone you know tell you that you have to learn one of the other we're gonna learn Python three just because it's I think probably the best for a beginner to learn and so that's the one that we want to download so I'm just gonna click download Python three and we're gonna go ahead and download this version and when that's done downloading I'm just gonna head down to my downloads folder and you'll see here we just have this file I'm just gonna double click and we get this like Python installer so I'm just gonna click through here and we'll be able to install Python 3 on our computer alright when that's done installing we can just close out of this and we should be good to go so now we have Python 3 installed on our computer the next step is we need to choose a text editor so we're gonna be writing a bunch of code so we're gonna need some you know environment or some program that we can write all that code in and really you can write Python in any text editor you could write it in like a notepad or TextEdit it doesn't really matter but there are special text editors that are designed just for writing Python code and these are called IDE s and that stands for integrated development environment it's basically just a special environment where we can you know run and execute our Python code and it'll you know basically like tell us how we're doing so if we're you know we write something that's wrong or we have errors it'll kind of point us in the right direction of what we need to do to fix that stuff so in this course we're gonna be using an IDE and one of my favorites and one of the most popular IDE s for python is called pycharm so I'm over here on this website it's called JetBrains comm /pi charm and this is the IDE that we're gonna be using in this course so I'm just gonna come over here and click this big download now' button and we'll go ahead and download this pi charm program alright so I'm getting this page over here you can see there's two versions of PyCharm one is a professional version not ones like paid so you have to pay for it but then there's this community version down here and that's free and opensource so I'm just gonna download this one and this should have everything we need to get started using Python all right when that finishes downloading I'm just gonna pull that up in my downloads folder and again we can just sort of run this guy and I'm on a Mac so I'm gonna have to drag it over to my Applications folder alright so we now have pie charm and we have Python 3 installed on our computer so we're ready to start programming in Python 



in this tutorial we're gonna create our first Python program and we're gonna be able to run it and see how everything works the first thing I want to do is open up PI charms so PI charm was the IDE the integrated development environment that we downloaded in the last tutorial so I'm just gonna go ahead and search for word on my computer and I can just open it up and when we first open up PI charm we should basically just get a window prompting us to create a project so you can see that down here actually the first thing I want to do though is come over here to configure and I'm just gonna click on preferences and I actually want to change the appearance so I'm gonna go ahead and give this a theme so I just went over here to appear in some behavior appearance and I'm gonna change the theme to dark yellow just because I think it's a little bit easier to use and look at but you don't have to do that if you don't want to and so down here I'm just gonna click create new project and it's gonna give us this little window right here so I can just name my project and I'm just gonna name this draft and then there's this other option down here where it says interpreter now what we want to select is Python version 3 so if I click down here you'll notice that there's a couple different options so I'm on a Mac computer and by default Mac has Python version 2 installed on it if you're on a Windows machine I'm not sure if it does but in this tutorial we're gonna be using Python 3 so you want to make sure that you have Python 3 selected as the interpreter otherwise you might not be able to fully follow along with what we're doing in this video so now I'm just gonna come down here and click create and this is going to go ahead and create our project for us alright so now we have our Python project up and running and I want to show you guys how we can create our first Python program so over here in this draft folder and this is just that project that we created I'm just gonna right click and I'm gonna say new and I'm gonna come down and click python file so we want to create a new python file this will be our first Python program and I can just give this a name why don't we just call this and I'm just gonna click okay all right so now we have our first Python file open and we can just start typing in some Python so I want to show you guys just a very basic Python program and this is just gonna be a HelloWorld program so we're just gonna print something out onto the screen so when I say what I want to do is I want to type out PR int print and I want to type in open and close parenthesis now inside of this parenthesis we can make some quotation marks and inside of the quotation marks I'm just gonna type out hello world so this is like a very basic Python program and what this is going to do is this it's just gonna print out hello world onto the screen so now what I can do is I can actually run this file and we're actually getting a little error here it wants us to create a new line at the end of the file and so now in order to run our Python program I'm just going to come up here to the top and I'm just gonna think run and we'll click this Run button right here and I will see what happens so it's asking me what I want to run I can just click app and down here at the bottom you'll notice that we have this text that just got printed out hello world so whatever I print or whatever I put inside of this print statement is gonna get printed out down below in the console so as long as you're getting that print statement to work then you've actually written your first Python program and as we go through forward in the course we're gonna be writing all sorts of awesome Python programs and we're gonna be doing all sorts of cool stuff 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about writing a basic Python program so we're gonna write just a very simple Python program we're gonna look at how we can go ahead and write our programs we're gonna talk about how our programs are getting executed by python and we're also gonna draw out a little shape on to the screen so this is gonna be pretty cool I'm excited to talk to you guys about just the bare basics of Python and really just sort of give you an introduction so over here we have our basic text editor so any of the Python code that I write inside of this file is actually going to get executed by Python so this Python file has a bunch of Python code inside of it and basically what we're doing when we're programming in Python is we're just giving the computer a set of instructions right that's really what programming is it's just like we're specifying a set of instructions and the computer's gonna go off and execute those instructions that we give it and so the more complex the instructions we give to the computer the more complex the tasks the computer can carry yeah so I want to show you guys how we can use some Python instructions or some Python code in order to draw out a shape onto the screen so I'm actually going to draw out a little triangle so over here we can actually print something out onto the screen and python using something called print statement so I can just type out print and inside of these parentheses I can just type some quotation marks and inside the quotation marks we can put whatever we want to print out on to the screen so I'm gonna copy this and I'm actually gonna make a few of these little print statements and we're gonna actually draw a shape so we're gonna draw like a triangle type shape so down here I'm just gonna draw a forward slash and then up here I'll make a space and we'll do another forward slash here we'll make two spaces will do another forward slash and over here we're gonna make three spaces and a forward slash and now I'm gonna draw like a vertical bars going all the way down and actually we can be some underscores here as well that'd be kind of cool alright so now we have our triangle looking shape and you can see it looks kind of like a right triangle so I can save my file and I can either come up here to run and click run app or if you're using PyCharm you can also just come over here and click this play button and when I click the play button I want you to notice what happens down here so down here we have this little window and this is called the console and basically the console is just a place where Python is gonna output some information so when we use this print statement we're basically telling Python like hey can you print something out onto the console so there's a lot of situations where we're gonna want to see what's going on in our code and we can use that print statement and print things out to the console and we can basically like have a little window into what our programs doing in our case we're just going to be printing out this triangle onto the console so I'm gonna come over here and click this play button and you'll see down here we're actually printing out that triangle so mission accomplished we were able to print out our shape so I could really draw any shape I wanted as long as I was able to specify it inside of these print statements so essentially what Python is doing when I click that play button is it's going into this file and it's looking at all of these instructions in order so the first thing it does is it goes to this instruction and it says ok they want me to draw out these like little forward slash in this vertical bar onto the screen once it does that it goes down to this instruction it says ok they want me to print something out again when it prints that out it goes down to this instruction etc so python is actually going to execute the lines of code that we write in order so the order in which I write the instructions matters a lot so for example if I was to take this last line here and put it up here at the top now when I save the file instead of just drawing out that triangle it's going to draw out this little upside-down bottom thing at the top and then the rest of the triangle down here so the order of the instructions actually matters a lot so this is basically how your Python programs are going to go as we go through this course we're gonna learn more and more of these little lines so here we're just using this little print function basically it just prints something out onto the screen there's a bunch of little things like this that we can as we go through we'll learn more and more instructions that we can give to the computer but in this lesson I just want to kind of show you guys the basics right we can essentially just define these little instructions for the computer and the computer will execute them in order 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using variables in Python now in Python you're gonna be dealing with a lot of data so a lot of times in our program we're going to be working with all types of information and data and values and sometimes that data can be difficult to manage so in Python we have this thing called a variable and it's basically just a container where we can store certain data values and when we use a variable when we put those data values inside containers it makes it a lot easier for us to work with and manage all of the different data inside of our programs so variables are extremely helpful and it's sort of like a core topic in Python that you're really gonna want to know and master so in this tutorial I'm going to teach you guys everything you need to know to get started with variables we're gonna look at what they are why they're useful and we'll look at the different types of variables and the different types of data that we can store inside of variables so over here in my Python file I just have a very simple program and it's basically just printing some text out onto the screen and so this is actually a little story that I wrote it says there once was a man named George he was 70 years old he really liked the name George but didn't like being 70 so this is a valid Python program I could go ahead and run this program and you'll see down here in the console everything prints out and it looks great so we have an awesome little Python program here but let's say that inside of our story I wanted to change the character's name so instead of naming the character George let's say I wanted to name the character John well I'm gonna have to go through and I'm gonna have to manually change the name George to the name John at every place inside of this story where it's mentioned so I'm gonna have to go over here and I'll say okay John I'm gonna have to manually change that and then okay down here we're gonna have to again manually type in John and change it to John so in order to change the character's name I have to manually go in and change it in both places and now let's say okay maybe we want to change the age also so in addition to changing the name we also want to change the age let's make them a little bit younger so why don't we say John is gonna be 35 so you'll see here I had to come here and manually change the age and then come down here and manually change it again right and now that we changed it like it's gonna work it's gonna be updated in our program but you'll notice that in order to make that change like I had to look through the entire program find that where that value was and change it and this was only with four lines of the story imagine if I had a story that was like thousands of lines long and we mentioned the character's name and age like hundreds of times I mean I'd have to look through each one of those lines and manually change the character's name and that is not a very good way for us to do this and it's really not a good way for us to manage the data in our program right the character's name and the age and so we can actually use a variable in order to store the character's name and the character's age and when we use that variable it'll make it a lot easier for us to put the character's name and age inside of our little program here so I'm gonna show you guys how we can create a variable for the character's name and age and I'm just gonna go up here above this print statement and up here I want to create a variable so when we create a variable in Python we actually need to give Python a couple pieces of information the first piece of information we need to give Python is the name of the variable so I need to actually assign a name to this container where we're gonna be storing information and so all I have to do is just type out the name of the variable that I want to create so I'm gonna create a variable called character name so I'm just gonna say character and I'm gonna say underscore name and so generally when you're creating a name for a variable in Python you want to separate different words with an underscore so I have two words here and I'm separating them with an underscore and now what I need to do is I need to put a value inside of this variable so basically what I can do is I can just say equals and over here I can type of that so I'm just going to type out the character's name inside of quotation marks so we're just gonna type out John so now we have a variable for the character's name and below this character named variable I want to create another variable called character age so I'm just going to type out character underscore age and I'm gonna set this equal to the character's age which is 35 so we now have two variables one representing the character's name and one representing the character's age so what I can do now is I can replace the character's name inside of the story with this variable and I'm gonna show you guys how to do that so if we want to put a variable inside of this print statement I'm actually gonna have to do a couple things the first thing I'm gonna have to do is end off this text in here so I'm gonna have to put a quotation marks here at the end and you can see I'm basically wrapping this whole thing into a single like quoted line and now I also have this text over here at the end so I'm going to have to put a quotation mark here so now I have a bunch of text here in quotation marks and then I also have text over here in quotation marks now inside of here instead of saying the character's name I want to refer to that character named variable so I'm just gonna say plus character underscore name and I want to say another plus sign so I basically am saying I want to print out all of this text plus the value that's stored inside of character name plus all of this text and what this will do is it will actually print out the character's name and we print this so I'm gonna go ahead and run this program and you'll see down here and actually let me put a space over here and we'll run it again so you can see down here we still are printing out there once was a man named John and so what Python is doing is when it executes to this line of code it's coming over here and it's seeing okay they want to print out the value inside of character name so it pythons gonna go up here it's gonna get the value and it's gonna insert it inside of there so I can basically do this for every instance of the character name in my file so I can you know I'll just copy this guy right here and I can just paste it down here where the character's name is so I'll paste this and you can see now we're doing exactly the same thing that we did up there I can also do this for the character's age so I'm going to come down here and I'll paste in what we just pasted it in and I'm gonna change this instead of character your name we'll change it to character age and I'm gonna do this in one more spot so we're gonna do this over here where we're mentioning the age and again I'll just change this to character age and so now when I run this program it's gonna print out the same story that we were printing out before but now I don't actually have to type in the character's name and the character's age I can just refer to this variable and the cool thing about variables is if I wanted to change the character's name now all I have to do is change it up here so I could change the character's name to like Tom or something and we could also change their age so I could change the age to be like 50 and now that's gonna automatically update throughout our entire story so when I click this play button you'll see now we're using the name Tom and he's 50 years old so that's where variables can come in handy and this can be a really awesome way to control and manage the data that's inside of our programs with variables you can also modify their values so for example let's say that halfway through the story I wanted to change the character's name well I can just make some new lines over here and down here I can actually assign a new value to one of these variables so I can say like character underscore name and in order to give it a different value all I have to do is just say equals and we'll give it a different value so let's say halfway through the story we want to change the character's name to Mike well now when I run into my program you'll see here in the first part of the story it says that once was a man named Tom and in the second part of the story it's referring to the name as Mike so I actually updated the variable inside of my program over here and that's a really awesome way you know a lot of times in these programs you're gonna want to be modifying the values of variables so you can do it just like that so finally I want to talk to you guys about the different types of data that we can store inside of these variables so over here I have the character name and the character age and I'm actually storing what are called strings so a string is basically just plain text right so the name tomm that's just plain text down here these guys are strings as well so there's a data type in Python called a string and it's just basically gonna store plain text so you know any text that you would have like in a story or you know someone's name you can store inside of a string there's also another type of data that we can store inside of Python which is numbers so in addition to storing text we can also store numbers so if I wanted to store a number for example let's say we wanted to store the character age instead of inside of a string we can store it inside of a number so I could just type out 50 and when we're storing a number we don't need these quotation marks you only need that quotation mark when you're storing a string so if I wanted to store a number I can just write it out like this and in addition to using whole numbers I could also use decimal numbers so I could say like fifty point five six seven eight two one three and pythons gonna be able to store that number as well so you can store all different types of numbers and we can also store what's called a boolean value and a boolean value is essentially a true or a false value and there's a lot of instances in programming where we're gonna want to represent true or false data for example I could have a variable called like is male and this would tell me whether or not someone was a male and in my case it would be true because I'm a guy right so I can actually this needs to be capital so I could sort a value of either true or false and actually if we were naming this in Python we want to use an SCOR so I would say is underscore mail and this can be either true or false so true or false values is maybe not something that you're used to dealing with like in the real world but in programming we're gonna be using true or false values all the time they're super important so like I said there's three basic types of data that we can work with in Python there's strings which is just like plain text numbers which would be like either decimal numbers or whole numbers like this and there's true or false values and these are the basic types of data I mean there's a bunch of other types of data that we can use but I would say 99% of the time as a new user and a new programmer to Python you're just gonna be dealing with these three types of data so those are the basics of the data and also with variables and you're gonna be using variables all the time in Python so you definitely want to practice up and get comfortable using them 


In this tutorial I want to talk to you about working with strings in Python now one of the most common types of data that we're gonna be working with and Python is gonna be strings and strings are basically just plain text so any text that we want to have inside of our program we can store it inside of a string so I want to talk to you guys about all the cool things we can do with strings and we're basically just gonna get a full introduction into why strings are awesome so over here I'm just gonna actually print out a string so I'm just gonna say print and inside of these parentheses I can type out a string in order to create a string I need to use quotation marks so I can make an open and close quotation marks just like that now inside of the quotation mark I can put whatever text I want the string to have so we could say like draft Academy and so now we have a string with the text graphic atom II inside of it so if I run my program now down here we're gonna print out draft Academy as you can see and when we have these strings there's actually a bunch of cool things that we can do with them so one thing I could do would be to create a new line inside of the string so if I wanted I can come over here and I could say backslash n and you can see it got highlighted in a different color and what this is gonna do is it's actually gonna insert a new line into the string so now it's gonna say draft on one line and Academy on another line so I'm gonna click play and you'll see down here we just get traffic Adam II in addition to the backslash n I could also use a backslash quotation mark so if I wanted to put a quotation mark inside of my string I can't just put a quotation mark like that because pythons gonna think that I'm trying to end this string so if I want to include a quotation mark I can just use this special backslash character and that's called the escape character and it basically just tells python that whatever character comes after it we want to render literally so when I say backslash quotation mark it basically means like hey Python I want a quotation mark and so now we'll be able to print out a quotation mark right there I can also use this to print out a backslash so if I needed to print out a backslash I could say backslash and it'll just print out a normal backslash now so you can see just like that so if you want you can use that backslash to make new lines or print out quotation marks or you can just use it as a normal backslash in addition to just typing out a string here I could also create a string variable so I could come down heat up here and we can create a variable and we'll just call it phrase and I'm gonna set it equal to draft Academy so I can store this string value inside of a variable called phrase and then when I want to print out that variable where I want to access that string variable I can just type the name of the variable and you'll see that it's gonna print out the value that was stored inside of it I can also use something called concatenation and concatenation is basically the process of taking a string and appending another string onto it so I could come over here and I could say phrase and I can say plus and now I can add in another string so I could say like is cool and now this is gonna say draf Academy is cool so I'm basically appending another string onto another one they call that concatenation and so in addition to doing all that stuff we can also use special things called functions and a function is basically just a little block of code that we can run and it will perform a specific operation for us so we can use functions to modify our strings and we can also use functions to get information about our strings so I'm gonna show you guys a couple of common functions we can use with these strings and they're actually gonna do awesome stuff so in order to access one of these functions I can just say phrase and then I can say dot and I'm gonna show you guys a function that we can use to convert this string entirely into lowercase so I could just say phrase dot lower and I'm gonna want to type an open and close parenthesis and this will take this phrase it'll take my string and it will convert it to lowercase so you can see now we just have graphic I mean down here but it's entirely in lowercase I could also do the same thing for uppercase so I could say phrase dot upper and this will convert the entire string into uppercase you can see now it's entirely uppercase so in addition to converting the string into uppercase and lowercase I could also check to see if a string is entirely uppercase or entirely lowercase so for example I could say phrase dot is upper and this is gonna give me back a true or a false value so it's gonna be true if this string is entirely uppercase or false if it's not and you can see here we're getting a false value because this is an uppercase I can also use these functions in combination with each other so for example I could say phrase dot upper and then a parenthesis and then after this I could say taht is upper and now what it's gonna do is it's gonna run this upper function it's gonna convert it into uppercase and then it's gonna run this is upper function right after that and you'll see now we're gonna get a true value back because it will have converted the whole thing into uppercase so you can see now we're getting a true value so you can use these functions one after another it can be really useful and there's a few other ones that I want to show you so we can also figure out the length of this string so if I wanted to figure out how many characters were inside of this string I could just say le n and I'm actually gonna make an open parenthesis and I'm gonna make a closed parenthesis so I'm essentially saying le n and this is another function it's the length function and inside of this le n function I'm actually passing this phrase variable I'm basically giving the length function this and it's gonna spit out a number so it'll tell me how many characters are inside of this string and so you can see here we get 15 because there's 15 characters inside of traffic atom II so that's how we can get the length of a string and that's gonna be really useful as we go forward and Python we can also get individual characters inside of a string so imagine if I wanted to just grab one of these characters like imagine if I wanted to figure out what the first character in this string is well can actually you is an open and closed square bracket just like that and in here I can specify the index of the character that I want to grab so if I wanted to grab the first character in this string I can put in a zero so if I say phrase square bracket zero this is going to give me that capital G and you can see down here that's what gets printed out now I want to point something out in Python when we're working with strings a string gets indexed starting with zero so you'll notice that in order to access this G I had to put a zero in here that's because in Python when we use indexes on a string we start with 0 so if python is counting the characters or its indexing the characters in a string it's going to start with 0 so it's going to say G is 0 I is 1 R is 2 a is 3 so we would say that G is at position 0 in the string I is at position 1 R is at position 2 a is in position 3 etc so we start counting at 0 so if I wanted to access the first character in the string this G I have to say phrase 0 and that's just a special thing in Python and actually most programming languages do that so they'll start with 0 so for example if I wanted to access this a I'm gonna have to put 0 1 2 3 so if I put 3 inside of here now we'll be able to access that first a as you can see we get an a right here so this is actually really useful being able to grab a specific character inside of a string and you're gonna be using that a lot as we go forward and python there's also another really awesome function that we can use and it's called the index function and basically what the index function will do is it'll tell us where a specific character or string is located inside of our string so I could say phrase dot index and I can actually give this a value so sometimes when we use these functions in Python we can actually give them information so I can give this a value and we would call this passing a parameter so I would call a value that I would give to a function a parameter and you'll hear that word a lot so for example I could say inside of here capital G and now this is gonna return the index of the capital G inside of our string so it should give us back a zero because G is at the zero index and you'll see down here that we get a zero because that's where G is so for example if I put an A inside of here like a lowercase a it should give me zero one two three because that's where the first a is inside of this string so I can click the play button and you'll see it's giving us a three you can also put actual words in here so for example I could put like Academy in here or I could even just put like AC ad and this is gonna tell me where this starts inside of my string so when I click play it's gonna give me an eight because that's where Academy starts right zero one two three four five six seven eight if I put something in here that wasn't in the string so for example if I put a Z in here that's not in here it's actually gonna throw an error so when I play this you'll see that we get this error down here because Z is not found inside of our program so that index function again can be really useful we'll be using that a lot there's also one more that I want to show you which is called replace so we can say phrase dot replace and in here I can actually give this two parameters so I can give this replace function two values that I can use and the first thing I wanted you to give it is what I want to replace so for example I could say giraffe and then I'm gonna put a comma in here and I want to put in here what I want to replace draft with so I could just say like elephant and now instead of saying draf Academy this is gonna print out elephant Academy so you can see down here it just says elephant Academy so this replace function can be really awesome because we can replace certain words or even certain letters inside of our strings with other ones so those are just some basic ways that we can work with strings inside Python and there's a lot of these different functions that we can use with strings these are some of the most common the ones that I just showed you right now but if you just do a Google search you can find all sorts of Python functions that you can try out and use and you know see what they do but you definitely want to get comfortable working with strings in Python because you're gonna be working with them a lot 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about working with numbers in Python numbers are one of the most common data types in Python and any Python program you write is most likely gonna be dealing with numbers at some point so I want to talk to you guys about just the basics of using numbers we're gonna talk about the different types of numbers that we can represent in Python and I also want to show you guys some awesome functions that we can use with numbers so we can do certain like mathematical operations we can do some awesome things with numbers I'm gonna show you guys all of that in this video it's gonna be awesome so first thing we can do is we can actually just like print out a number so if I want to write a number in Python it's really easy I basically just write the number so I could say like print 2 and this is just gonna print the number 2 out onto the screen so I can use a whole number like this I could also use a decimal number so I could say like 2.0 9 8 7 and python is gonna be just fine with that will be able to print that out onto the screen as well I can also make numbers negative so I could make this 2.0 9 8 7 a negative number and Python will be able to handle that just fine too in Python we can also use basic arithmetic so I can do things like addition subtraction multiplication so I could say like 3 plus 4 and now this is gonna print this out or why don't we say like 3 plus 4 point 5 and this will be able to print out the answer so we get 7 point 5 and we can do addition we can do subtraction we can do division or we could do like multiplication as well so you can pretty much do whatever you want inside of Python and if you want to make more complex mathematical equations we can also use things to specify order of operations so I could use parentheses so for example if I said 3 times 4 plus 5 what Python is gonna do is it's gonna multiply 3 and 4 together so it's gonna be 12 and then we'll add 5 to that so we should get 17 but let's say that we wanted to change up the order right I could actually put a parentheses around 4 & 5 and now it's gonna add them so it'll add 4 and 5 so we'll get 9 and we'll multiply that times 3 so we should end up with 27 so you can see we can use those parentheses to specify order of operations so I could make like a very complex little equation here just by using numbers and parentheses we can also use one other operation which is called the modulus operator so I could say like 10 and use this % 3 and this is actually red 10 mod 3 and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna take the first number divide it by the second number and it's gonna spit out the remainder so it's basically gonna say ok 10 divided by 3 that's gonna be 3 with a remainder of 1 and so this is going to give us the remainder and you'll see down here we get 1 because that's the remainder of 10 divided by 3 and that modulus operator can come in handy quite a bit we can also store these numbers inside of variables so we can store them inside of these variable containers so I could come over here and I could create a variable called like my underscore num and we'll just store a value of let's say like 5 in here and so I could come down here and I can just print out my underscore num and we'll be able to print that number out to the screen just fine so in addition to doing things like a basic arithmetic we can also do some other stuff so one thing I could do is I could actually convert this number into a string so if I wanted to convert this number into a string I can just say STR and I can put the number that I want to convert inside of these parentheses and so what's gonna happen now is this number is going to be converted into a string so when I click the Run button you'll see it's just printing out 5 but now instead of being a number this is actually a string and this is gonna come in handy when you want to print out numbers alongside strings so I can come over here and I can say like my favorite number and we'll be able to print this number along with this string so I can click play and it says 5 my favorite number if I was to get rid of this string right here and I wasn't converted the number into a string now pythons gonna have a problem with this it's not gonna allow us to do that you can see we get an error so anytime you want to print out a number next to a string you got to make sure that you use that little string function so there's a bunch of other stuff that we can do with numbers and a lot of times in Python you're gonna want to be using specific like more advanced math operators so there's a bunch of different math functions that we can use on our numbers and a function is basically just like a little collection of code that does something so a function could perform an operation like a mathematical operation on our number it could also give us information about our number so I'm gonna show you guys some of the most common functions that you'll be using and Python related to numbers the first one is called ABS and it stands for absolute value so we can get the absolute value of a number and so over here I'm just gonna make this variable negative 5 and basically I can just say abs and I can make an open and close parentheses over here and this is gonna give me the absolute value of this number up here so when I click the play button you'll see it's just giving us 5 because 5 is the absolute value of negative 5 I can use a few other functions there's another one which is called POW it's so it's just P o W and I'm actually not gonna use this variable we just use a normal number and this function is gonna allow us to pass it two pieces of information so I can give this function two pieces of information the first is going to be like a number and the second is going to be the power that I want to take that number to so I could say like 3 comma 2 and this is basically just gonna be 3 raised to the power of 2 so it's just gonna be 3 squared so we should get 9 down here you can see that we do so I could pass in like you know some crazy number like we could pass in a 4 and we could raise it to the power of 6 and so we should get like a pretty big number here and you can see we get 4096 so this power function is really useful for taking numbers to specific powers so in addition to using this function we can also use another function which is called max so I can say max and what this is gonna do is it's basically going to return the larger of the two numbers that we pass into it so right now I'm giving this a 4 and a 6 and this should tell us which number is higher so over here it's just printing out 6 because that's the bigger number I can also use another function called min and this is gonna do the opposite so now instead of printing out the max number it's gonna print out the smallest number and it's gonna print out 4 down here as you can see another cool function is called the round function and this is gonna allow us to round a number so it's just gonna follow like standard rounding rules so if I said like 3.2 inside of here now it's gonna round it down to just normal 3 but if I said like 3.7 it's gonna round it up to 4 so that'll allow you to round a number so there's a few other functions that I want to show you guys but in order to get access to them I'm actually gonna have to do something called importing and in Python we can actually import external code into our files and so if I want to access these specific math functions I have to import something called Python math so I can just say from up here math import and this star and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna go out and it's gonna grab a bunch of different math functions that we can use so I already showed you guys a few of these different math functions but there's actually a bunch more and in order to access them we're gonna need to include this line of code inside of our file so once we have that now I can access a few others so there's another function which is called the floor method and it's just F L oo R and what this will do is it'll basically just grab the lowest number so it's essentially just gonna chop off this decimal point and you can see over here now we get a 3 because we're using that floor function there's also another one called seal and that's just gonna do the exact opposite so that's just gonna round the number up no matter so no matter what we'll always get for with we have a three-point whatever here and there's another one which is called square root so it's just sq RT and essentially this is just gonna return the square root of a number so I could say like 36 and now we should get six back so those are all some very interesting functions and inside of this math module so we would call this a module and you don't have to worry too much about what that is right now just know that when we put this line of code into our program it gives us access to a lot more math function so though it basically allows us to do a lot more things with math inside of our program and there's a bunch of different math functions in Python and if you want you can basically just go online and search for different math functions I showed you guys a few here and I would say the ones that we looked at here are probably the most commonly used but there's a bunch more and like I said you know there's tons of documentation on all this stuff so you can just look up you know math functions in Python and there's gonna be tons and tons like lists of these things that you can use inside of your programs to perform different math operations but for now that's just been a little bit about using numbers a little bit about doing you know certain math operations and using functions with those numbers 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to get input from a user so we're basically gonna allow a user to input information into our program and I'm actually gonna take the information that the user inputs I'm gonna store it inside of a variable and then we're gonna be able to do something with that variable so I want to show you guys how we can actually go about getting input from someone and down here in my Python file all I have to do to get input from someone is I just have to type out input and then an open and closed parenthesis and what this is basically gonna do is it's gonna tell Python like hey we want to get input from a user and Python will allow the user to type in some information and inside of these parentheses we can actually type a prompt and so generally when we want the user to enter in some information we want to tell them what we want them to enter and that's what we can put inside of here so I'm just gonna say enter your name so we're actually going to create a little Python app which is gonna allow the user to enter in their name and then we'll store the name inside of a variable and then we'll basically just say hi to the user so we'll say like hi and then whatever the name they entered was so what I want to do is I actually want to store whatever the user inputted into our program inside of a variable so I can actually go over here and I can create a variable I could just call it a name and I could set this variable equal to input so what I'm doing now is I'm taking the value that the user inputs and I'm storing it inside of this variable container called name and so now I have access to whatever they entered in so what we can do is we can say print and inside of the parentheses I can just print out hello and then I'm just gonna add on to this name and actually why don't we put an exclamation point so essentially we're getting a name from the user we're storing it inside of the name variable and I'm printing out onto the screen so I'm gonna go ahead and play this and when we run the program you'll notice down here python is giving us this little prompt so it's saying enter your name now in here I can actually type in a value so I can type in Mike and then I can just hit enter and pythons gonna go ahead store this value inside of that variable and then it's gonna print out hello Mike and so this is kind of cool and actually what we could do is we could prompt the user to enter in more than one piece of information so I could actually copy this line of code and I'm gonna paste it below here and why don't we have the user enter in another variable so we can have them enter in for example their age and over here we just want to say enter your age so now we're able to get two pieces of information from the user and I could say hello name and then I can say you are and I'll print out their age so I'm just gonna print age so now I'm basically able to get both of these pieces of information from the user I can get their name and I can get their age so when we run this program I can type in both of those pieces of information so to say answer your name so we could just make up a name like John and then enter the age let's say John is 25 and now it's gonna say hello John you are 25 so the program is able to get input from the user and then it's able to use that information in order to say hi to the user and tell them how old they are and so getting input from the user is a great way to make your programs more interactive and here we're just scratching the surface right we're just basically getting to you know a piece of information from the user but you can use these inputs to do awesome things in Python and as we go through to this course you're gonna see some really cool things that we can do with these inputs 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to build a very basic calculator in Python we're basically going to build a calculator where we'll get two numbers from a user and then we'll add those numbers together and print the answer out onto the screen so this will give us some practice in getting input from users and we'll also talk about getting numbers from users as opposed to just strings so I'm really excited to get started on this calculator the first thing we want to do is create two variables and inside of those variables we want to store the two numbers that the user wants to add together so down here I'm just gonna say num1 and that's what we'll call our first variable is equal to and now I need to get input from the user so I'm gonna say input and inside these parentheses I'm gonna say enter a number and now I basically want to do the same exact thing but for the second number so we'll paste this guy down here and I'm just gonna say num - and then we'll just say enter another number so now we're able to store the user's input inside of these two variables so now all I want to do is just print out the result so I'm actually gonna create a variable called result so I'm just gonna say a result is equal to and basically we just want to add these two numbers together so I'm gonna say num1 plus num2 and now all we have to do is just print out the result so I'm just gonna print result so we basically have our entire program written out here and this will allow us to enter in two numbers and then we'll add them together and print out the answer so I'm gonna click play and down here we can enter our number so I'm gonna enter the first number we'll say five and I'm gonna enter my second number so let's say 8.0 or let's say eight point three so now it should print out the answer but if you look over here that's not quite the answer we were looking for right five plus eight point three is definitely not 58.3 and here's what happened when we get input from a user by default python is just gonna convert it into a string so it doesn't matter what we put down there when we're entering the numbers pythons always just gonna be like okay this is a string that's it sounds good right it's just gonna make it a string in order for us to make these num1 and num2 variables numbers we're actually gonna have to convert the strings that we get from the user into numbers and so the way that we can do that is by basically just coming over here and when we add the two numbers together I can use a special python function in order to convert those strings into numbers and there's actually two Python functions that we could use for this the first is called int so I could say int I can make an open parenthesis and I can make a close parenthesis and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna convert whatever is inside of these open and close parentheses into an integer number and an integer number is basically a whole number so it's like 1 2 3 4 5 so it's a it's a whole number another word that can't have a decimal point and so what I could do is I could say int and I could put these inside of parenthesis and now what this is gonna do is it's gonna convert both of these numbers into integers in other words into whole numbers that don't have decimals and it's gonna add them together and we'll print out the result so why don't we do that and we'll just see if this works so I'm gonna click the play button and down here we'll enter our first number so I'm just gonna enter in a 4 and then I'll enter in a 5 and now you can see it's printing out the correct answer 4 plus 5 and so that's essentially our basic calculator but we do have one problem with this calculator so I'm gonna run it again and I'll show you guys what that problem is if I wanted to add in a decimal number so we'll add 4 point 3 and 5 point 5 you'll see that we're getting this error and that's because I'm using this int function up here and this int function is looking for a whole number so if I put decimal numbers inside of there it's gonna break the program there's another function we can use instead of an int we can save float and a float is basically just a number that has decimals so it's a decimal number and so I can convert both of these guys into floats and now I'll be able to use decimal number so I can click play and I can just enter in some numbers so I could say like 4 and I could also say like 5.5 and now it's gonna be able to add both of those numbers even if one of them is a decimal and that's the beauty of using that little float function so in certain circumstances you might want the user to only be able to enter in an integer to a whole number but in a lot of cases like in this calculator we want them to be able to enter any number that they want so we're gonna use this float function so I'm just gonna recap what we did one more time we created two variables num1 and num2 and we basically stored the two numbers that the users inputted into those variables then we converted them into numbers and we added them together and we printed out the results so this is a pretty cool calculator I'm happy with it hopefully you guys learned something and as we go forward in this Python course you're gonna learn all sorts of ways that we can make this calculator more complex 



in this tutorial I want to show you how to build a mad libs game in Python so a mad libs game is basically just a game where you can enter in a bunch of random words so like you know verbs nouns names colors and you basically take all of those words and put them into a story randomly so over here I my web browser I just have an example of a mad libs so you know down here we're basically just taking random words like an adjective or a noun or a plural noun and entering them in side of a story so like you read through the story and then like some random word pops up in Mad Libs can be pretty fun and I'm sure you guys have you know at least heard of Mad Libs before but if not that was just a little introduction so I'm gonna create a Mad Libs in Python and this is gonna be really cool so down here I have this like a little poem it just says roses are red violets are blue I love you and so you know this is kind of like classic poem but I think we should mix it up a little bit and create a mad lib for this poem and so instead of having this red color over here I want to have the user enter in their own color instead of having violets why don't we have them enter in a plural noun and instead of saying I love you why don't we have them say I love and then some celebrity so celebrity so this is the basic structure for our little Madlib right I want to basically have the user enter in a color enter in a plural noun and enter in a celebrity and it'll take all of those words and put them inside of our Madlib and hopefully we end up with something that's pretty funny so how can we actually go about building this in python well the first thing we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to be able to get these words from the user right that's pretty obvious so I think what we should do is we should create three variables called color plural noun and celebrity and we'll store the user's inputs inside of those variables so up here let's create those variables the first video of what I want to create is gonna be called a color so say color and I want to set this equal to the input so I'm going to input and inside of here I'm just gonna give them a prompt so I'll say enter a color and we can basically just copy this line of code and I'm gonna paste it down below and we'll paste one more time so now we're gonna create our plural noun variable so I'll say a PLU ario plural noun and we'll just say enter a plural noun and actually over here I want to make a colon as well so then finally we'll create our celebrity variable and we'll say enter a celebrity and so now basically we're creating three variables called color plural noun and celebrity and inside of them were storing the color that the user enters the plural noun the user enters and the celebrity the user enters so the last thing we have to do is replace these guys with those variables so I'm basically just going to add in the color over here and we're gonna add in the plural noun so I can just go like this and finally we'll just add in that celebrity so now we have a pretty cool Madlen and it should be functional everything should work it looks like it's good to go so let's come over here and we'll run our program and then down here in the console we can play our little Mad Libs game so they enter a color I'm just gonna say magenta enter a plural noun why don't we say microwaves and enter a celebrity let's say Tom Hanks so when I click enter what should happen is we should get our Mad Libs print it out so I'm gonna click enter and now we have our Mad Libs so it says roses or magenta microwaves are blue I love Tom Hanks so it's a pretty good mad lib and obviously you know the more the more print statements we put over here you know the better the Madlib could have could be and we could store as many you know variables up here as we wanted this was just a very simple mad lib we only took in three inputs but you know you can see how you could take something like this and create a little Mad Libs game so your homework for this lesson is to go off and make your own mad libs game hopefully one that's a little bit funnier than mine but that's the basics of creating a mad libs game in Python 


11 -------- NO TRANSCRIPT --------------



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using functions with lists in Python when python a list is one of the most important structures where we can store our information a list basically allows you to take a bunch of different values and organize them and store them inside of their own little list structure so down here in my program you can see i have two lists i have a list of lucky numbers and this is just a bunch of different numbers and then i have a list of friends so this could be like a list of somebody's friends and it's basically just a bunch of strings with names in them so these two lists are storing a bunch of different values and what makes list awesome is not only can I store like this many values I mean I could store hundreds or thousands or millions of values and when you're working with a lot of data and a lot of information of Python these lists are invaluable so because lists are so important there's actually a bunch of different functions that we can use with lists and those functions allow us to do things like modify the lists and get information about the lists so in this tutorial I just want to show you a bunch of those functions we're going to talk about some of the most common and the most popular functions that you would use on lists to make them more powerful and make them more easy to use so the first thing we can do is obviously just print out a list so down here I'm printing out this friends list and when I wonder and when I run my program you see down here we're just printing out all the elements in the list so it's always good to be able to print out all the elements inside of a list but there's a lot of other functions that we can use so one function is called the extend function and the extend function will basically allow you to take a list and append another list on to the end of it so I could say like friends dot extend and inside of these parentheses I can pass in the list that I want to add on to the friends list so I could say like lucky numbers and now when I print out this friends list not only is it going to have all the elements in the friends list it's also going to have all the elements inside lucky numbers list you can see down here we have all of our friends and then we also have the numbers over here so that's a really easy way to essentially just like add two lists together we can also just add individual elements on to a list so I could come down here and I could say friends dot append and this will actually allow me to append another item on to the end of this list so over here I could just add another name so we could say creed for example and now I'm like adding another friend on to the end of this list so when I run the program in addition to having the original items that were in the list up here we also have this additional item at the end and that append function is always gonna add the item onto the end of the list but let's say that you wanted to add an item into the middle of the list so like right here or right here there's another list function called insert and insert is going to take two parameters the first parameter is going to be the index where you want to insert the item so why don't we insert it here at index position one I'm just gonna say one and then I'm gonna type in the name of the element that I want to add so we can just say like Cowie and now at index position one we're gonna have the value Kellie and all of these other values are going to get pushed up they're gonna get pushed to the right one index position so now when I run the program you can see we have Kevin this new element Kellie and then all the other elements have been pushed off to the right we can also remove elements so for example let's say I wanted to remove this Jim value all I have to do is just say friends dot remove and I can just type in whatever element I want to remove so I want to remove this Jim element and so now when we run the program Jim is gonna be gone from the list and we just have these four guys left you can also remove all of the elements from the list so if I just wanted to completely like reset the list and get rid of everything I could just say friends got clear and this is gonna give us an empty list so to get rid of every single element inside the list there's also another really cool method which is called pop and you can just type out pop like that and basically what pops gonna do is it's gonna pop an item off of this list so when I click the play button you'll see here that we're left with kevin caron jim and oscar so we basically got rid of the last element inside the list and that's what pop does it pops an element off of the list so it basically removes the last element in the list so we have our list but let's say that we wanted to figure out if a certain element was in this list right if a certain value is in here so let's say I wanted to check to see if my friend Kevin was in this list well I could say friends dot index and in here I can just pass a value so I can say like Kevin and this is gonna tell me the index of Kevin so it'll tell me if Kevin's in the list so now when I click play you can see down here it says zero if I was to say like Oscar in here for example now it'll give me the index of Oscar so that's it three but if I put a name that wasn't in here so like if I put Mike that's not in the list and so now we're gonna get back in error because it says Mike is not in the list so that's an easy way to figure out if a specific element is inside of the list and if it is then you'll know what index it's at you can also count the number of similar elements in the list so I'm actually gonna come down here copy this gym element and we'll add another gym element into here so I could come down here and I could say friends dot count and we'll pass in gym and this will tell me how many times the value Jim shows up inside of this list so it should say two which it does down there because we have two values with the text Jim and so we have all these values we could also sort this list so I could come over here and I could say friends dot sort and what this will do is it'll sort the list in ascending order so we have a bunch of text here and you'll see what it does basically what it's going to do is it's going to put it alphabetical order so you can see we have JK o and T so the list went from being just random order like whatever we had up here to now it's in alphabetical order and that's also gonna work for lucky numbers so I could say like lucky numbers dot sort and then we'll print out lucky numbers and these should now be in ascending order which I'm realizing they already are up here but if I was to take this 42 and put it down here now it will figure everything out and put it in a sending order anyway we can also reverse a list so if I wanted I could reverse this not lucky numbers list I could say lucky numbers dot reverse and now when we print it out instead of being 42 8 15 16 23 it's gonna be 23 16 15 8 42 so it's basically just reverse the order of the list and finally there's one more list function I want to show you guys which is copy so I could actually create another list and I could make it as a copy so I could say like friends too and we could set this equal to friends copy and now friends 2 is gonna have all the same attributes as friends because it's basically just like copied it basically took a copy of that friends list so you can see it's the same exact thing and copying list can come in handy in a lot of different situations so those are just some basic list functions and just kind of like you know get your feet wet and working with lists obviously like the more you work with them the more you practice using these different functions the more comfortable you're gonna get but that's just kind of like a basic overview of what you can do 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about tuples in Python now a tupple is a type of data structure which basically means it's a container where we can store different values now if you're familiar with lists in Python a tuple is actually very similar to a list it's basically a structure where we can store multiple pieces of information but a tuple has a few key differences from lists that we're going to talk about in this tutorial first thing I want to do is I want to show you though how to create a tuple so I can come down here and I can create a tuple and one of the most common examples of tuples is coordinates so let's say I had a series of like XY coordinates I could create a variable called coordinates and I'm just gonna set this equal to an open and closed parenthesis and whenever we want to create a tuple inside of Python we're gonna use these open and closed parenthesis and inside of here inside of these parentheses we're gonna put the values that we want to store so I could for example put a list of numbers so this could be like my coordinates I can have like 4 and 5 so this would be my with coordinates inside of it and one of the things about tuples that makes them unique is a tuple is immutable and you'll hear that word a lot when we're talking about tuples immutable it basically means that the tupple can't be changed or modified once we create our tupple up here you cannot modify it you cannot change it you can't add elements to it you can't erase elements from it you can't change any of the elements inside the tupple what-you-see-is-what-you-get once you create the tupple it's it's as it as you can't change so I can come down here and I can print out some of the attributes inside the tupple and the way I can access them is just by using an open and closed square bracket and in here I can pass in a index so tuples are indexed starting at 0 so technically we would say that 4 is that index position one in Ferb sorry for is it index position zero and five is that index position one so if I said coordinates zero now it should print out four and down here we're printing out four so if I wanted to print out that five we can just put a 1 inside of the square brackets and now we'll print out that 5 so I can access the elements inside of a toughie I can easily access each entry but if I was to come over here and try to change one of the elements so if I said coordinates and coordinates 1 and I tried to set it equal to something else like 10 Python is actually gonna give us an error when we run this program so I'm gonna run the program you see we get this error it says type error tupple object does not support item assignment because it's immutable because we can't change it so that's basically what tuples are how we can create them and you know a couple like I said it's very simple you just create it and then you have it and now I want to talk to you guys about a common topic in Python which is the difference between tuples and lists so remember a list is basically doing the same thing a list if we wanted to create a list we would just use square brackets instead of those parentheses and if I was using a list I could assign different values to it I can I could basically mutate any of the elements I could add delete modify change whatever I wanted with the list but with the tupple we can't do that and that's sort of the basic difference and really a Python doesn't say anything more than that it basically just says like one of them is immutable one of them is not but in practical use cases generally people will use tuples for data that's never gonna change so you'll store data inside of a tuple when that data doesn't need to be mutated that's why something like coordinates is such a good candidate for a tupple because once you have coordinates like we're probably not gonna modify them right we might add other coordinates so for example if I wanted I could create a list of tuples so I could say like 4 or 5 6:7 maybe we have some other coordinates like a t-34 so here I have you know I have a list and inside of it we have these tuples but remember these tuples can't be modified the values can't be changed so really it's just a case-by-case basis I would say by a huge majority you're gonna be using lists most of the time tuples are more of a niche you know they're using more special situations but there are plenty of situations where you want to use tuples so if you're in a situation where you want to store data that can't be changed or mutated then tuples are the way to go so yeah that's just some basics about tuples some basics about the difference between lists and tuples and so a tuple is a great thing to add into your Python repertoire 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using functions in Python now a function is basically just a collection of code which performs a specific task so I can take a bunch of lines of code that are basically doing one thing I could put them inside of a function and then when I wanted to do that task or do that one thing that the function was doing I can just call the function and so functions really help you to organize your code a lot better they allow you to kind of break up your code into different you know little chunks that are doing different things and they're really just awesome so functions are like a very core concept when we're talking about programming in Python so I'm gonna show you guys how to create an awesome function today let's say for the purposes of this tutorial we want to create a function that says hi to the user so the one task that our function performs is basically just saying hi to whoever is writing the program so over here if I want to write a function the first thing I have to use is a keyword in Python it's called def so d EF and basically when Python sees this keyword it's gonna say okay this person wants to use a function so after we type out def we need to give this function a name so just like when we are creating variables we give them descriptive names we also want to do the same thing with functions so if I'm creating a function I can just give it a specific name which basically says like what it's doing so we're gonna create a function that says hi so I'm just gonna call this function say hi just like that and once we type out the name of the function and so also I could type out say hi with no underscore or I can type out say hi with an underscore both are considered like good practices and Python a lot of times if you just have a simple like two word function like this you don't need to put an underscore but we could put an underscore there if we wanted after we type out the name of the function I'm just gonna type into open and close parentheses and then I'm gonna type a colon and basically what this is doing saying to Python like alright all the code that comes after this line is gonna be inside of our function and in order to write code that's gonna end up being inside the function we actually have to indent it so over here you'll notice that when I clicked enter my text editor automatically indented the text so it's automatically like using this indent here and that's kind of like one of the rules in Python is like the code that goes inside of this function needs to be indented so if I was to write some code like out here this is no longer gonna be considered inside the function so you can see as I type out code and obviously this isn't real code but as I type text over here that's indented this little like marker over here it's basically saying like oh yeah that's inside the function but then when I write code over here that is like not at the same indentation level as this stuff it's no longer considering it inside the function so that's just a little thing any code inside this function needs to be indented alright so our function is just gonna say hi to the user so I'm just gonna have it print out some text it's gonna say hello user so this is a very simple function obviously we just have one line of code and inside of a function you could have you know as many lines of code as you want but for our purposes we only need one line in order to perform our function so now all we have to do is call this function so if I want to execute the code inside of this function I have to do something called calling it so if I was to just run my program as it is right now I'm just gonna run it you'll see that nothing happens over here right even though this function is printing out hello user when I run the program it's not doing it and that's because of the code inside of a function isn't gonna get executed by default the code inside of a function is only going to get executed when we specify that we want to execute it and in order to do that we're gonna have to do something called calling the function so in order to call the function you basically just type out the functions name and those open and close parentheses so I'm just gonna type out say hi and open and close parentheses and now when we when we run this program again you'll see that it prints out hello user so we're executing the code inside of the function and I want to show you guys just one more thing here just talking to you guys about how these functions actually work so up here I'm gonna print top and then down here I'm gonna print bottom so I want to show you guys the flow of these functions inside the program so when I run this program you'll see we print out top hello user and then bottom so essentially what's happening is when python goes through and execute this program it goes over here to this first line it says okay we want to print out the word top and then it goes down here and it says okay we want to execute the say hi' function so python actually jumps up and it goes over to this say hi' function and it's gonna execute all of the code inside of this function so it's gonna go through execute all this code and then once it's done executing all the code in the function it's gonna jump back down here and it's gonna move on to the next line which is bottom so that's kind of like the flow of functions again with functions generally when we're naming these functions you want them to be named in all lowercase and usually when we're naming stuff in Python if there's two or more words we're gonna use an under space or an underscore in between them so I could write this out as say underscore high but in a lot of situations though if I have a function like this where the name is really short I might just be easier to leave it without an underscore but why are we just put an underscore in there just to be super Python official alright so now we can actually make these functions a little bit more powerful and what we can do is we can give them information so a lot of times when we write a function we're gonna want to have additional information that gets passed in and these are called parameters so a parameter is a piece of information that we give to the function so over here I can actually specified that this function needs to receive some parameters so I can basically say like hey if you're gonna call this function you need to give us some information you need to give us some parameters and all I have to do to do that is just type out the name of the parameter that I want to receive so why don't we allow the code calling this function to tell it what name to say hi
up here I can just say name and basically what this means is it means whenever I call this say hi function we have to give it a name so down here if I was to call this I have to include a name in here so I can say like Mike and what we can do now is we can actually access this parameter or this variable inside of our function so I could come over here and instead of saying hello user I could say hello name and basically what this is gonna do is it's just gonna say hello to whatever name got passed in here so I'm actually gonna copy this and we will do this twice so I'll say hello Mike hello Steve and now when I run this program you'll see that instead of just saying hello user it's saying hello to whichever name I passed into the function so that's why this can be really useful right we can give the function information and depending on the information we give it it'll perform its task a little bit differently I can also include more than one parameter so you can I mean technically you could have like as many parameters as you want so I can put another one in here we could say age and now I'm gonna have to pass in an age along with these so I'm just gonna pass in age and pass in an age for down here and I'm just gonna pass in strings so we can say hello name you are age so I'm passing in two pieces of information and now when we run this program it's gonna call the function and it's gonna use both of those pieces of information so say hello Mike you are 35 hello Steve you are 70 so essentially we're writing out this one line of code which just prints out like Hello to someone and we're allowing this function to receive two parameters so the name and the age and depending on the name and the age the function is gonna print out hello a little bit differently and that's kind of the beauty of using functions so you could pass anything you want into a function so for example I could pass in a integer instead of a string for the age so like I could pass in a number the only difference is over here we're gonna have to convert this into a string but it's gonna work just the same so you can pass in strings numbers boolean's arrays you can really pass any type of data into a function and it's gonna work so you can see here we get the same result so that's the basics of functions and as you go through with Python you're gonna you know be using functions more and more and generally it's a good idea to break your code up into different functions so whenever you have like a grouping of code that's designed to perform a specific task that's usually a good candidate to be put inside of a function 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using the return statement in Python functions now a Python function is basically just a collection of Python code that performs a specific task and when we want to perform that task in our Python programs we can call a Python function and a lot of times when we're calling a Python function we just kind of call it and it does its thing and then we move on with the program but sometimes when we call a function we're actually gonna want to get information back from that function so when I call the function I want it to basically execute its task I want it to execute all the code and then I want it to like give me some information back so that could be like a particular value it could be something like telling me how the task went basically the function can just communicate back to us like hey here's some information and that's what the return keyword can allow us to do the return keyword can basically allow Python to return information from a function so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do this I want to create a very simple function and it's just going to cube a number so when we cube a number we take it to the power of three so if I was gonna cube like two it'd be like two raised to the power of three right it's just pretty basic math so we're gonna make a function that will cube a number and I'll show you guys how we can use that return statement so first thing we want to do is make a function I'm just gonna say def cube will call the function cube and over here we can specify any parameters that this function will take so basically any values that we want to give this function so we're gonna give it one function which is just gonna be a number so I'm just gonna call it num and then over here I'm gonna type out a colon and then down here we can put any of the code that we want to be included in this function so basically this function is just gonna cube this number so we could just type out num times num times num right that's gonna give us num so that's all well and good if I come down here I can execute this function so I can basically just call it I'll say cube and why don't we pass it a three so I'm gonna go ahead and pass it to three and I'm gonna save this and now let's go ahead and run this code so we're on the code and you'll see down here nothing happened right so nothing got printed out in our program in fact when we called this cube function it didn't really do anything so let me try to print this out so maybe we print this function out it'll give us back the information that we want so what about print and we'll print out the value of the function I'm just gonna click play we will look down here it says none so when I printed out the value of this function it told me none but really this function is supposed to be cubing the number and here's how we can use the return statement in Python I can come over here and I can just say return and now python is gonna return whatever value we put over here to the right so when I call this cube function and I give it a three python is gonna go off its gonna execute this function when it sees this return statement it's gonna say okay I want to give a value back to whatever call of this function and it's gonna return this value now when I print out cube 3 it should print out the answer because we get an answer back so when I play this you'll see down here it says 27 so we got the correct answer so I could do this with anything why don't we cube like 4 or something so now I'll run this and you can see we're constantly getting the correct answer back so that's the basics of using this return statement it allows us to return a value back to the caller in other words back to whatever is calling the function so I just want to illustrate this point a little bit further I'm gonna come up here I'm actually gonna create a variable so I'm gonna create a variable called result and I'm just gonna set it equal to cube for this variable result is gonna store the value that gets returned from the queue function so it's it's not gonna store like cube for it's gonna store the value that gets returned from executing that function so now if I came down here and printed out result it's actually just gonna print out 64 again because that's the value that it's storing so this return statement can be really useful for like getting information back from a function we can use something like a parameter like this for as a parameter and we can give information to a function and then we can use the return statement to get information back from a function and I do just want to point out one more thing I'm actually not able to put any code after this return statement so if I came down here and tried to put like a print statement this actually isn't gonna work so this is never gonna get printed out so if I just typed out like code right here when we run this program it's not gonna type out code that's because when I use this return keyword it breaks us out of the function so pythons gonna go through it's gonna execute the code in the function whenever it sees this return keyword it's just gonna break back out and we're gonna be done so we'll never be able to reach this line of code so that's the basics of using return statements and you can return any data type you want we could easily return like a string or a boolean or an array it doesn't really matter you can return whatever you want and a lot of times in a lot of situations you're gonna want to get a value back from a function 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using if statements in Python now if statements are a special structure in Python where we can actually help our programs to make decisions so by using an if statement I could execute certain code when certain conditions are true and I could execute other code when other conditions are true so basically if statements allow our programs to respond to the input that they're given so depending on the data that we're using in the program our programs will be able to respond so when certain data is certain values we can do certain things and when other data is other values we can do other things so it you know your programs are essentially becoming a lot smarter and actually if statements are things that we as human beings deal with every day so you know as you go throughout your day generally you're dealing with if statements all the time so I want to kind of give you guys a brief introduction into if statements and we'll talk about some of the common if statements that you'd see in everyday life and then we'll go ahead and do a really awesome example to kind of like show you guys what if statements can do for us so over here in my text editor I just have this little text file and in here I wrote out a bunch of if statements that a lot of people will encounter on a daily basis so here's the first one it says I wake up if I'm hungry I eat breakfast so let's break this down a little bit up here it says if I'm hungry and this is a condition right this is either gonna be true or it's gonna be false right if it's true I'm gonna go ahead and eat breakfast right if it's false I'm just gonna skip whatever was in here and move on alright so that's the basics of an if statement right we have a condition in this case if I'm hungry if the condition is true then we do the action so we breakfast otherwise we just skip it so down here we have another one it says I leave my house if it's cloudy I bring an umbrella otherwise I bring sunglasses and so this one is a little bit more complex than the one we just looked you'll see we have our condition right it says if it's cloudy if that condition is true we're gonna bring the umbrella but in this case if the conditions false there's something else that we want to do so in the case up here if this condition was false we just moved on but now if this condition is false then we're gonna go ahead and bring sunglasses so that's another example of an if statement it's a little bit more complex finally I have one more down here and this one's even more complex it says I'm at a restaurant if I want meat I order a steak so if this condition is true we order the steak but if this condition is false then we're gonna move on and we're actually going to check another condition so I'm gonna say otherwise if I want pasta i order spaghetti and meatballs this is another condition if this conditions true we get the spaghetti if it's not true then finally we're gonna move on down here and we'll just default to ordering the salad so all three of these if statements are valid if statements it's just they get more and more complex as we go down the list so hopefully that's you know you can kind of wrap your head around what if statements are we're basically specifying conditions if those conditions are true we're gonna do certain things and if those conditions are false we can do other things or we can check other conditions all right so let's head over to our Python file and we'll start writing some actual Python so in here in my app dot Python file I want to create an if statement and I'm gonna show you guys a very basic if statement in this tutorial and then in the next tutorial we're gonna look at some more advanced if statements and so what I want to do is create a boolean variable so I'm going to create a boolean variable that's gonna store whether or not the user is a male so it's just gonna be called is underscore male and I'm gonna set this equal to true because I'm a male so we have this boolean variable right and right now we have it set equal to true I can actually use an if statement to check to see what the value of this variable is and if it's true I can do something so if I want to use an if statement all I have to do is just tie if and then I just need to type out a condition so basically I would have to type out like something that's going to be true or false like for example in the other page we were specifying like if I'm hungry or if it's cloudy here we're just gonna check to see if is male so in other words if the person is male and so remember this has to be ate like it has to be able to be reducible to a true or a false value so in our case we're just using a boolean because that's like the easiest thing we can do so I said if I specified my true or false condition and now I want to just type up : and what I want to do now is make a new line so anything that I put below this with an indentation is actually going to be executed when that conditions true so I could put print and down here I could just put you are a male and now you'll see what happens when I run this program it's gonna go down here and it's gonna say you are a male but if I changed is male to false so instead of this being true I just change it to false now all of a sudden it's not gonna print anything so it's just gonna be blank down here that's because this condition wasn't true so anything that I put below this if declaration and that has an indentation like that is going to be executed when the if statement is true we can also use another keyword in Python which is called else and Alice is basically gonna be like otherwise so you remember before we said if it's cloudy I'll bring an umbrella otherwise I'll bring sunglasses well this is gonna be like our otherwise so I can say down here else and now anything that I put below else is going to get printed out when that condition isn't true so why don't we just put you are not a male so now we're able to cover both of the situations for this variable if it's false we can cover that situation so it says you are not a male if it's true we can cover that situation as well so it'll say you are a male so that's pretty cool but we can also make these more complex and actually before I talk about that you can put as much code as you want inside of an if statement so I could have like you know dozens of lines of code if I wanted I'm just giving you guys a very simple example so why don't we make this more complex and I'm gonna add another variable into the mix so I'm gonna add another you know boolean attribute into this mix I'm gonna make another variable called is tall and we're gonna set this equal to true as well so now I have two variables in the mix let's say I wanted to write an if statement that will check both of those variables so I could write an if statement that's like if they're male and they're tall or if they're male and they're not tall or if they're not male and they're tall like I could write out a bunch of if statements to check the combination of these variables so the way I can do that is by using one of two keywords so the first keyword I want to show you guys is the or keyword so I can come over here and I can say if is male or is underscore tall and what this is basically gonna do is it's gonna say if the person is either male or if they're tall then we want to do something so this is only going to be true when one of these values is true when one or both of those values is true so down here we could actually put instead of you are a male we could put you are a male or tall or both that's gonna be more appropriate and then down here we would say you are neither male nor tall and that's because if we execute the code inside of this else that means that both of these guys are false right so I'm saying if they're male or they're tall we're gonna execute whatever is in here otherwise that means they're neither male nor tall we're just gonna execute this down here so let me show you guys how this works I'll click play and these are both true so it's gonna say you are a or tall or both if I was to set one of these to false so let's set ismael equal to false now it's still gonna say you are a male or tall or both but if I set them both equal to false now it's going to say you're neither male nor tall so that's how the basics of using the or operator and there's another operator we can use which is called and and basically it's similar to or except both of these conditions have to be true so this is basically saying if the person is male and they're also tall then we're gonna execute whatever is in here so we could actually change this text to say you are a tall male because we know for a fact that if this is getting executed they're both male and tall we can also change this print statement down here this could say you are either not male or not tall or both so you can see it's basically just saying that you're either not one of them or you're not both of them so we click the play button and you'll see because they're both false it's gonna say you are either not male or not tall or both but if I make them both true now it's gonna say you are a tall male if I was gonna make one of these false those so let's make is tall false now it's not gonna execute this first print statement it's going to execute the one inside of the else so to say you are either not male or not taller both so that's the basics of and and or and you know you'll be using those a lot as you use your if statements but there's actually one more thing we can do we can add in some more conditions so up here I'm checking if they're male and they're tall but what if I wanted to check if they're male and they're not tall so if they're like a short male I can use another keyword in Python called elsif or really it's just typed out a LIF and it stands for elsif and after this we can put another condition so over here I'm gonna check to see if there and they're not tall so I'm gonna say elsif mail is mail and now I can type in not tall and the way I can do that is by saying not and open a closed parenthesis and saying is tall and basically when I use this not function it's going to negate whatever is inside of here so if this was true it's gonna make it false and if this was false it's gonna make it true so basically that'll tell us whether or not they're tall and then I'm gonna use a colon and now down here inside of here we're basically just gonna type out any of the code that we want to happen when this condition is true so down here we can just print out you are a short mail and there's actually one more condition that we want to check for which would be if they're not male and they're tall so we can make one more else if and I'm actually just gonna copy this guy and we'll paste it down here and so I want to say if not is male and is tall so now we're checking to see if they're male and or if they're not male and they're tall so here we could say you are a you are not male but are tall so essentially here we have an if statement that's going to cover every single condition for these two variables so in every single situation of the two values of these variables we're gonna be able to print something out for it so if I made both of these true it's basically gonna tell us you are a tall male if I make is male false it's gonna tell us you are not a male but are tall if I made is male true and is tall false then it's gonna tell us you are a short male and if I made both of these false it's gonna tell us you are either not male or not taller both and actually we need to change this so this should say you are not a male and not tall so that would be a better printout for that situation so you can basically see how we can use ifs else ifs and else in order to help our program to make decisions and really to respond to the different data in our programs so I'm able to respond to every combination of the values for these two variables and that's really cool so in this example we were just using simple boolean variables but in the next tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how you can actually use something called comparison operators so we could compare like two numbers or two strings and we could use those as our conditions but for now I think this is a good introduction into if statements so I'll see you guys in the next tutorial 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you some more about if statements in Python more specifically we're going to be looking at using comparisons inside of our if statements so if you're following along with the course in the last tutorial I talked to you guys about just the basics of if statements and we used a couple different boolean variables and depending on the values of those boolean z' we were able to do certain things in this tutorial we're gonna look at another way to use if statements which is with comparisons so instead of just using boolean values we can actually compare different values so like I could compare a couple numbers or I could compare a couple strings and depending on the results of those comparisons we can do certain things so this is gonna be pretty cool and this is really gonna give you guys a full understanding of what you can do with if statements so for this tutorial I actually want to create a Python function and this function is going to give us the maximum number that we pass in to it so this function is going to take three parameters as input and it's gonna print out the biggest number that we give it so let's create this function I'm just gonna say def and I'm just gonna call it max num and inside of these parentheses I'm gonna specify that I want three parameters as input so I'm gonna say num1 num2 and num three so basically we're passing it three numbers and this function will return the largest of the three so in order to figure out which of these numbers is the largest we're gonna have to use an if statement so I can say if and over here I need to specify a condition right so I need to put like a true or a false value and so what we can actually do is we can compare these different numbers so I could say if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and num1 is greater than or equal to num 3 so basically what i'm doing here is i'm comparing these different numbers so i'm saying if the first number is greater equal to the second number and this is a comparison so when you think about it when we compare these two numbers we're going to end up with a true or a false value right num1 is either greater than or equal to num - or it's not it's actually a boolean value right it's either true or its false same thing over here the result of this comparison is either true or its false so technically I'm putting a true or false value in there I'm just getting that true or false value by using a comparison and you'll notice over here we're using something called a comparison operator and basically this is just like how we want to compare them so we're saying like greater than or equal to in this case so down here if this whole condition is true in other words if the results of these two comparisons end up being true then we know that num1 is the biggest so I can just return num1 I can say return num1 but we also want to check some other conditions so I can say LF and now I want to do some other comparison so I'm gonna say else if num2 is greater than or equal to num 1 and num2 is greater than or equal to num 3 so I'm doing essentially what I did up here except for num2 so again I'm comparing these different numbers and this is gonna end up being a true or a false value depending on the result of the comparison so down here again we can just return num2 because of all this is true that means we're gonna end up returning num2 and then finally we can just say else so if num1 isn't the biggest and num2 isn't the biggest then we can pretty much assume that num 3 is the biggest so now we have our function so down here I'm actually just gonna call this function so I'm just gonna say actually I'll print out the result so I'll say max num and we'll pass in like 3 4 5 so we're basically calling that new function that we just made and I'm gonna go ahead and run this program so you can see down here in the output we printed out five because that was the biggest if I was to change this middle one to the biggest so we make the middle one forty now it'll be able to take on that situation and finally I can make this like three hundred and it'll be able to handle that so no matter which number num1 num2 or number three ends up being the biggest it's able to tell us without a problem so these comparisons are a really really really common way to make if statements and a lot of times you're gonna want to be comparing different values inside of Python so over here we're comparing numbers but we can also compare strings so I could easily make these both like you know I could make this like dog and I can make this dog and I could say a different operator so I could say like this double equal sign would mean equal so I could basically say like if this string is equal to that string so you can basically like compare all different data types you know I can compare numbers strings you can also compare boolean's so once again these are comparison operators and this one is greater than or equal to but there's a bunch of other comparison operators we can use so the most basic is just going to be a double equal sign and that basically checks to see if the two values are equal so it'll say like if number one is equal to number two we can also say not equals and this exclamation point will basically mean not equal so it's if num1 is not equal to num - we also have greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to and those are kind of all of the operators are all the you know the basic comparison operators that you're going to be using in python so using comparisons is really awesome and there's gonna be tons and tons of situations inside of Python where you're gonna want to compare differ values so these can be extremely useful 



in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about building a calculator in Python now if you've been following along with this course you'll know that in the beginning of the course we actually created a very basic calculator basically the user could just enter in two numbers and our calculator would add the numbers together and spit out the answer and this is horrible I want to show you guys how to build a more advanced calculator so this calculator is going to be able to perform all of the basic arithmetic operations so we can add subtract multiply and divide and we'll actually allow the user to specify which one of those they want to do so the user will enter in a number they'll enter in whatever operator they want to use so plus minus divide multiply and then they'll enter in the second number and we'll perform the operation for them so this can be pretty cool and it's going to show you how we can use if statements in like a practical application so let's get started the first thing we want to do is get input from the user so I'm going to create three variables one for the first number one for the second number and one for the operator and we'll basically store the values that the user inputs into those variables so the first one will just be num1 and i'm gonna set this equal to input and we're gonna give this a prompt so i'll say enter first number and here's actually the thing is whatever the user enters we're gonna want to convert it into a number so generally in python when we get input from the user no matter what they put in it just gets converted into a string but we don't want a string because we're gonna have to be adding or subtracting or multiplying these numbers together so whenever they enter in the number I just want to immediately convert it to an actual like number data type instead of a string so what I can do is I can actually say float and I can surround this entire input tag with parentheses and now what this is going to do is it's gonna immediately convert whatever the user inputs into a float now that's gonna mean that they're gonna have to insert a number otherwise we'll get an error but for the most part this should work out for us so I'm actually just gonna copy this guy and we'll go ahead and paste it over here and we'll paste it one more time so we're basically just trying to get three pieces of input from the user so the second thing we want to get is the operator so I'm just gonna say o P for operator and I'll actually get rid of this float because we want to keep this as a string and I'll just say enter operator so that's gonna be like plus minus multiplication whatever and then finally down here we'll get num2 and again we're gonna want to convert this to a float so I'll say enter second number so now basically what we're doing is we're getting the first number we're getting the operator and we're getting the second number from the user so what we need to do now is we need to figure out what is inside of this opie in other words we need to figure out what operator the user was trying to do so are they trying to do addition are they trying to do subtraction like we want to figure that out so we can use an if statement in order to figure that out so I'm gonna come down here and I'm basically just gonna create an if statement so I'm gonna say if and we want to check a condition so I'm basically going to check to see if this operator is equal to a plus sign so I can say if opie equals plus sign and now if the operator is equal to plus sign I'm just gonna print out num1 plus num2 but let's say that instead of a plus sign they entered in something else so we can say L if o P is equal to and now we'll check if it's a minus sign and so here we'll just print num1 - num2 and actually forgot to put a colon here so we can just do these for everything so now we can say L if opie is equal to division and here we'll just divide the two numbers so I can print out num1 divided by num2 and finally we'll do the same thing for multiplication so say L if Opie is equal to Asterix and we'll just print out num1 times num2 all right so basically over here we have every you know condition but I also want to put in an else statement so in the case that the user enters in an operation that's not like one of the four that we specified up here I just want to throw an error so I'm just gonna say Oh P or actually we just say else and here we'll just print out like invalid operator all right so this if statement should give us everything we want basically I'm just checking to see if it's equal to a plus sign a minus sign the division sign or a multiplication sign depending on which one is equal to we'll do a different operation so let's go ahead and run this and see how we do so I'm gonna run this program and it says enter first number let's enter 5 enter an operator so why don't we just do addition and enter a second number let's do 20 3 so now it prints out the answer 28 so our calculator actually works let's try another operator just to make sure so we'll do 6 and why don't we multiply it by I don't know 5 point 2 3 so now we go off and we do the multiplication and it looks like we got our answer so our calculator seems to be working and so basically all we did was we got the input from the user and then we used if statements to figure out what they wanted to do right so we could check to see if they wanted addition we could check to see if they wanted subtraction or division or multiplication and we could also check to see if they entered in an invalid operator so actually why don't we try that too so I'll enter it in like 5 and now we'll just enter in like and open a closed parenthesis and a 4 so you can see here it's able to tell like the program smart enough to know that that's not a valid operator so these if statements can be really powerful and we can use them and come with getting the user input to create a little calculator 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using dictionaries in Python now a dictionary is a special structure in Python which allows us to store information and what are called key value pairs so essentially I can just create a bunch of these different key value pairs and then when I want to access a specific piece of information inside of the dictionary I can just refer to it by its key so the word dictionary is actually pretty appropriate here if you guys are familiar with a normal dictionary you know in a normal dictionary you'd have a word and then you'd have a definition associated to that word so in this situation the word would be the key in other words the word is what like uniquely identifies it inside of the dictionary and then the value would be the actual definition so this is gonna make more sense once we start working with this but I just wanted to give you guys a quick introduction so in this tutorial I want to create a little program that will allow us to convert a three digit month name into the full month name so I can convert for example like J a n2 what I could convert M a are into March like I want to be able to have a program that can do that for us and that's actually a pretty good use case for a dictionary so we're actually gonna create a dictionary and I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that so the first thing we need to do in creating a dictionary is just give it a name so I want to give this a specific name so I'm just gonna call this month conversions and now I just want to set this equal to an open and closed curly bracket so whenever we create a dictionary in Python we're always going to want to create it inside of these open and closed curly brackets so inside of the dictionary now we can just start defining what are called key value pairs so I can define a key and then I can give it a corresponding value and the way that we can do that is just by typing out the key and then typing out the value so in our case we're converting three digit month name into the full month names so I would want to type out for example J a n and then I can type a colon and I want to type out the value I want to associate with it so we could say January I could basically do this for every combination so I could say like Fe B and this would be February and actually after each one of these we're gonna need to put a comma so I could do the same for March and say ma R so essentially what I can do is I can specify an entry inside of this dictionary for each one of these so this over here would be the key and this over here would be the value and here's one thing is all of these keys have to be unique so if I was to come down here and change this to J a n this is actually gonna give us a little warning so you can see down here that says dictionary contains duplicate keys that's a no-no when we're creating dictionaries so you always want to make sure that the keys are unique alright so I'm gonna go ahead and create one of these for each one of the months and then we'll come back and we'll talk about it alright so I've gone ahead and created an entry for all 12 of the months so now we have a bunch of unique keys and each one of those keys is associated with a different value so this is the basics of creating a dictionaries we have a bunch of these different key value pairs and now what we can actually do is we can access them from inside of this dictionary so if I wanted to access a specific key or a specific value all I have to do is come over here and I'm actually just gonna print it out onto the screen so we can see it all I have to do is refer to the dictionary by name so it's just called month conversions and there's actually a bunch of different ways that I can access these month names so I could access different entries inside of this dictionary the first way is just by making a open and close square bracket and inside here I can just type in one of the keys so for example inside here I could type in Oh V and what this should do is it should give us back the full name for November so when I print this out you'll see that we get back down here November so I could do the same thing for you know any of these we could say like ma R and now we should get March back so I'm able to refer to the key and it's gonna go into the dictionary and it's gonna give me the value that's associated to that key there's actually another way we could do this too so I can say month conversions dot get and inside of here I can also pass in the name of a key so I could pass in like Dec and now we'll be printing out December and what's cool about using this gate function is I can actually specify a default value that I want to use if this key is not found so there's gonna be certain cases when we're dealing with dictionaries where you're gonna put in a key that might not necessarily map to a value inside of the dictionary so you put in an invalid key so let's just try to do that so I'll just put like a UV that's not a month abbreviation so when I try to run this you'll see we get this none down here and in a lot of cases you're gonna want to create some sort of a default value so if I'm in this situation where I have a key that's not mapable to any values inside of this dictionary I can actually pass it a default value so inside this dot get function I can make a comma and now I can pass in like a default value to get printed out so I can say like not a valid key and now when I put in the invalid key instead of saying none it's gonna go ahead and say not a valid key so this is gonna give us like a default value that we can fall back on so these dictionaries are really awesome and the keys over here don't have to be strings so you could also use numbers so for example I could say like 0 1 10 like I can put any numbers I want over here as keys as long as they're unique and then I could access those just like I normally would down here with this get function or with those open and close square brackets so that's one of the basics of using dictionaries they can be really useful to store key value pairs and honestly you're gonna be using them a lot in Python to store different types of data 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about while loops in Python now a while loop is basically a structure in Python which allows us to loop through and execute a block of code multiple times so I could specify like a few different lines of code and then I can put that code inside of a while loop and it would basically loop through that code executing it repeatedly until a certain condition was false so while loops can be awesome and there's a lot of situations in Python where we're gonna want to loop through specific lines of code so in this tutorial I just want to show you guys the like bare basics of how while loops work and then in future tutorials we're gonna use while loops to create little games and stuff like that so let's talk about while loops when I create my while loop the first thing I want to do actually is create an integer and basically creating a variable that's a number and you don't have to do this for a while but just for our demonstration I'm going to so I'm just gonna call this I and I'm gonna set it equal to 1 and now what I want to do is I want to create a while loop so I'm basically just gonna say wile and over here I want to specify a condition and this is what's called our loop condition or you can also refer to it as a loop guard and basically we are gonna keep looping through the code inside of the while loop as long as this condition is true so whatever condition I put in here as long as it's true we're gonna keep looping through the code inside the while loop so I'm just gonna say while I is less than or equal to 10 and now I'm gonna put a colon and I'm gonna make a new line and so anything that's below this while loop declaration and that's indented like this is going to be considered code that's inside the while loop and so that code is gonna get repeatedly executed while this condition up here is true so I'm just gonna put a very simple line of code here we're just going to print out the value of and then down here I'm gonna actually increment I so I'm going to add one to I so I'm going to say I is equal to I plus one so basically I'm taking this I value and I'm adding 1 to it there's actually a shorthand that we can use in Python to do something like this though I could just say I plus equals 1 and that's automatically going to add 1 to I so this is like a little shorthand and you'll see people in Python using that a lot so over here we basically have our while loop so I have the outline for a while loop so we're defining this variable up here and we're gonna keep looping through the code inside the while loop as long as this condition up here is true so if this condition is false for example if I is equal to 11 then we're not going to loop through this code anymore we're just gonna move on so down here I'm actually just gonna print done with loop so this will kind of illustrate this for us all right so let's go ahead and run this program I'm just gonna run it and you'll see down here we get some output so we're actually gonna get numbers printed out 1 all the way down through 10 and then we're printing out done with loop so basically what's happening is we're printing out every time we go through this loop so initially I is equal to 1 right the first thing that pythons gonna do when it gets to this while loop is it's gonna check this condition so before it does anything else it's gonna check this condition and it's gonna say okay is 1 less than or equal to 10 and that's true so as long as this guy is true we're going to go through and loop through all the code inside of here so we're gonna print out I which has the value of 1 and then we're gonna add 1 to I so now I is going to go from 1 to 2 now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go all the way back up here to this while loop declaration and we're gonna check the condition again so remember I checked the condition the first time and then I loop through all the code then I go back up to the top check it again so I'm gonna say okay is I less than or equal to 10 at this point I is equal to 2 so I is less than or equal to 10 so now we're gonna go through and we'll execute all this code again so I'm gonna print out I so it's gonna be 2 and I'm gonna add 1 to I so now we have 3 then python is gonna go all the way back up to the top and it's gonna check the condition again so on every iteration through the loop before python does what's inside of this loop it's gonna check that condition and as long as the condition remains true we're gonna keep executing the code inside the loop eventually though in this program I is gonna end up being 11 right so on the last iteration it's gonna end up being 11 we're gonna come back up here and we're gonna say hmm is 11 less than or equal to 10 nope and so sense it's nope we're gonna come down here and we'll print out this done with loop line so that's the basics of how these wire loops work we're specifying a loop condition as long as that conditions true we'll keep executing the code inside of the loop and after every execution of the loop we're going to come back up and check the condition again so that's how we end up with this printing out down here so that's the basics of a while loop and we can use these while loops to do all sorts of things like while loops are very very powerful 


in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to build a basic guessing game in Python and in this guessing game we're actually going to be using all sorts of cool programming structures that we've learned up to this point in the course so we're gonna be using things like if statements and while loops and variables and all these cool things in order to build this game so the basic idea is we will specify like a secret word so we'll have a secret word that we store inside of our program and then the user can interact with the program and try to guess the secret word and so what we want to be able to happen is we want the user to be able to keep guessing what the secret word is and keep typing in different responses until they get the secret word right so that's the basics of what this game is gonna be and now let's go ahead and create it so the first thing we want to do is create a variable to store our secret word so I could say secret word and we're just gonna set this equal to a secret word so why don't we make it draf that's a pretty good secret word and now what we want to do is we want to create a variable that will store the user's response so I want a variable that will store like all the guesses that the user makes so I'm just gonna call this guess and I'm just gonna set it equal to an empty string right now so now we have the secret word and we have a variable to store the user's guess and what we need to do is we need to be able to prompt the user to input the secret word but here's the catch what we want to happen is we want them to enter the secret word and if they don't guess it correctly we want to prompt them to enter it again so we can't just use a single input statement we actually have to use something called a while loop and we can use a while loop in order to continually ask the person to guess the word until they guess it correctly so let's go ahead and create our while loop so I'm gonna say while and after I say while I need to specify a looping condition or a looping guard basically this is something that as long as it's true we're gonna keep looping through this loop so basically I want to say I want to keep looping as long as the users guess is not equal to the secret word so as long as they haven't guessed the secret word I'm gonna keep going through this loop and inside of this loop what we're gonna do is we're gonna ask them to input the secret word so I can take this guess variable and I can set it equal to input and I'm just gonna say enter guess so over here we're basically telling the user to enter in their guests I'm storing whatever they enter inside of this guess variable and then what's gonna happen is we're gonna come back up here we're gonna check to see if the guess is equal to the secret word if the guess isn't equal to the secret word then we're gonna do it again but if the guess is equal to the secret word then we're just gonna break out of this loop and so we can come down here and we can just print out a success message so I could say you win because they got the secret word so this is a very very simple program but this is essentially all of the code that we need to be able to build a game like this so let's go ahead and play our game we can run it and see how we did so I'm gonna click play and down here you can see it's prompting us to enter a guess so I'm just gonna type in some you know random text we can type in whatever we want and as long as we're not entering that secret word it's gonna keep prompting us to enter different information but if I enter in the secret word so if I enter in a draft now all of a sudden the program is gonna terminate and it's gonna say hey you win because we were able to guess the secret word so that's like a really cool way for us to be able to do this and we actually have a fully functional guessing game but I think this guessing game could actually be improved quite a bit a lot of times when we're making a guessing game we want to set a limit so in other words I want to set a limit for the number of times that the user can try to guess the word so let's say that the user has three tries right they have three guesses in order to guess the word and if they can't guess the word out for three tries then they're gonna lose the game but if they can guess the word inside of three tries then they'll win the game right I think that would be a little bit more of a fun game so why don't we try to program that game basically we're going to set a limit on the number of guesses that the user can have in order to do this we're going to have to create a couple more variables down here in other words we're gonna have to store a couple more pieces of information the first piece of information I want to keep track of is how many times the user has guessed right so we can just make a variable called guess count and we'll just set this equal to zero because initially the user won't have guessed down in this while loop every time we go through the loop I want to increment that guessed count right so every time we've gone through this wildly I want to increment that count because that means the user will have guessed so down here I'm gonna say guess count plus equals one and this is just gonna add one to the guessed Scott actually whoops alright so after each iteration of this loop we're gonna go ahead and add one to the guest count all right so that's the first variable that we're gonna need we're also gonna want to store another variable and this is gonna be called guess limit and basically this is gonna tell us how many times the user can guess the word so I'm gonna it's gonna be guess limit and we'll basically just say three so let's say that the user has 3 tries to guess the word 3 strikes and you're out so the user if they can't get it in three tries then we're gonna basically say that they lose the game and I'm also gonna need one more variable here which we're gonna call out of guesses and I'm just gonna set this equal to false initially so this out of guesses variable is gonna be a boolean and it's gonna tell us whether or not the user is out of guesses so if out of guesses is true that means they have no more guesses right they basically lost the game and if out of guesses is false that means that they still have some guesses left so they can keep playing all right so let's use these different variables in order to make our program more functional so the first thing I want to do is when I go through this loop I want to check to make sure that the user has more guesses right in other words before I let the user enter a guess I want to check to see that they haven't already used up all their guesses so down here I can make an if statement I can say if and inside of the condition I want to check to see that guess count is less than guess limit if guest count is less than guess limit that means that they haven't guessed the total number of guesses that they have so they have some guesses left and if that's the case and if that's true then I'm gonna go ahead and give them a guess and then we'll increment the guest count if this isn't true in other words if they have reached their guessed limit then I'm gonna want to set out of guesses equal to true because they're out of guesses right they have no more guesses because the guest count wasn't less than the guessed limit and so that means that they're out of guesses so they have no more guesses so there's actually one more thing we need to do inside of this while loop we need to add another condition on to this loop guard so right now we're gonna keep looping as long as the guess is not equal to the secret word but remember if the user is out of guesses in other words if they've reached their guessed limit we don't want them to guess any more right so if they ran out of guesses then we want to basically break out of this loop and not give them any more guesses so I'm gonna go ahead and add another condition onto here and I'm gonna say wow they haven't guessed the secret word and they're not out of guesses so it's gonna be not out of guesses then we're gonna keep looping so as long as they haven't guessed the word and as long as they still have some guesses left we're gonna keep looping but otherwise we're gonna break out of the loop and so down here we're printing out you win but actually when we break out of this loop there's gonna be two possible scenarios so again there's two possible ways that this loop could end right either the guess is equal to the secret word so either the user guess the word correctly or the user ran out of guesses and so there's two situations down here that we need to account for and so I'm gonna use an if statement to figure out which is which so I'm gonna say if and we're just gonna type out of guesses and if the user is out of guesses then I want a print of you lose so we're basically gonna be like you lost the game otherwise though if they're not out of guesses that means that they guess the word correctly so we're just gonna print out you win all right so now we have all the logic for this little guessing game set up and let's see if we can run it and play through it so I'm just gonna run this program and now it's gonna tell us to enter a guess so why don't we enter more guesses than we have so we're gonna try to lose the game so I'm just gonna enter one guess two guesses and now I'm on my final guest so if I don't get it here we should actually lose the game and you can see it says out of guesses you lose so we weren't able to guess it in the number of tries that we had let's run the program again and we'll try to win the game so we'll get a couple wrong let's say we're on our last guess and I'm like okay I can do this so I type in the word and BAM we won the game so that's how we can basically create a game where we have a guess limit so this is a lot of code let me walk you guys through this one more time so you can just get a full understanding of what we're doing up here I created a few different variables we created this secret word variable and we created this guest variable then we also created some more variables so we created this guess count variable and this just keeps track of how many times the user has guessed the word and you can see down here every time we give them a guess we're incrementing the guest count we also have guests limit and guests limit is telling the program how many times the user can guess so before I go through this while loop the first thing I'm doing is I'm checking to see that the guest count is less than the guest limit in other words do they still have some guesses left if they do then we're going to get the input from the user otherwise we have this other variable up here called out of guesses and out of guesses is going to tell us whether or not they have some guesses left so if this is equal to false that means they have some guesses if it's equal to true however it means no more dice no more guesses they are done so they lost the game the last thing we needed to do is specify an additional condition up here so we are going to keep looping through the code inside of this loop as long as the conditions up here are true so as long as they haven't guessed the word and as long as they're not out of guesses we are going to keep looping through and so when eventually the user does break out of this loop there's going to be two possible situations the first situation is that they ran out of guesses and so we want to check to see if that's the situation I want to check to see if they're out of guesses if they are we'll print out a lose message if they're not then they must have guessed it correctly so they win and so that is how we can use while loops and if statements and also variables in combination with each other to build a pretty awesome guessing game 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using for loops in Python now a for loop is a special type of loop in python which allows us to loop over different collections of items so a lot of times we'll use for loops in python too like loop through different arrays or we can loop over like the letters inside of a string or we could just loop through like a series of numbers so for loops provide a very specific purpose and the easiest way to kind of wrap your head around why for loops are useful is just for me to show you guys a bunch of different examples so that's exactly what I'm gonna do we're gonna look at why for loops are awesome so down here in my text file on my Python file I'm gonna write out a couple different for loops so the way that we create a for loop is just by saying for and now what I want to do is specify a variable and this variable is going to essentially represent a different value every time we go through this for loop and you guys will see how that works in a second but just know that this variable is going to be used on every iteration of our for loop and each time it will most likely have a different value so in our case I'm just gonna call this letter and I'm gonna say for letter in and now what I want to do is I want to specify a collection that I want to loop over one example of this would be like a string so I could put a string in here I could just put like a draft Academy and now I can just put a colon and so basically what this is gonna say is it's gonna say for every letter inside of draffa Kadim ii i want to do something and so down here inside of this for loop and again we need to indent this we can put what we want to do with each letter so let me just show you guys like basically what this is gonna do so i can print out a letter so i can print out this letter variable and it's actually gonna print out a different letter inside of this draft academy string on every single iteration this loop so I'm gonna run this program and down here inside of my console you'll see that I'm basically printing out draff Academy so on the first iteration of the loop I printed out the first letter in draft Academy which was G on the second iteration of the loop I printed out I third was our fourth was a so I'm essentially just looping through all of the letters inside of draffa Khadem ii so i'm saying for each letter in draft academy i want to print out that letter and so this is kind of like how four loops can be used we can define a variable and that variable will change on each iteration of the loop right so on the first iteration of the loop this letter variable represented a g on the second iteration of the loop the letter variables store to the value I etc right so we went through this entire string we were able to print out each letter so in addition to using this with strings we can also use this with other collections for example like an array so if I created an array up here let's just call it friends I'm gonna set this equal to a bunch of different values so we can put like a list of our friends in here we can say like Jim Karen and Kevin instead of saying the letter why don't we call this friend and I could say for friend in friends and now we'll print out the friend so over here I'm saying for each friend inside of this friends array I want to print out the friend so now we'll actually be able to print out each element inside of that array so down here you'll see we're printing out Jim and then on the second iteration we're printing out Karen and on the third we're printing out Kevin so I'm able to loop through all of the values inside of the array and just so you guys know like you can name this variable whatever you want so I could name that I could give this like any random name and if I want to access it though I have to access it using that same name so we can loop through something like an array we can also just loop through a series of numbers so I could say index over here and again this can be anything I'm just gonna call it index so we could say for index in range and then in here I can pass in a number so I could pass in like 10 for example and down here I'm just gonna print out the index when I run this program you guys will see that it's basically going to print out every number in the range from zero to ten not including ten so starting with zero it's gonna print out 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 but notice that it didn't print out 10 so it's essentially just printing out all the numbers between 0 and 10 not including 10 you can also specify a range of numbers so I could say for example like 3 and 10 and now this will print out all the numbers between 3 and 10 not including 10 so we're on this program and you can see we print out 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and not 10 so whatever value that you put here in this second position is not going to get included in the range and ranges can be really useful so for example I could use a range to loop through an array just like we did before so if I wanted I could say something like 4 index in range and now inside of this range I can pass in the length of the array so just so you guys know if I wanted to get the length of this array in other words if I wanted to figure out how many elements were inside of it I could just type out le N and then inside parentheses the name of the array and so this is gonna spit out 3 because there's three elements inside of here right kind of makes sense so what I can do is I can say down here inside of this range function I can just type in le n and then friends and so what this is gonna do is it's gonna essentially give me a range between 0 and the number of friends inside of this list so down here I could actually type out friends index and this will allow me to access each in friend inside of this list just like we did before but now I'm doing it with a range so you can see I'm typing out Jim Karen Kevin so actually for each iteration through this loop it's basically gonna be printing out friends zero friends one and then friends two because in here were passing in a three and remember whenever I pass in there it's gonna range from zero all the way up to that number but not including that number so that's another way that we do print out all the elements in the array and looping through something like an array is actually a very very common use case for for loops but like I said we can use for loops to loop through essentially any collection that we have so we could loop through like a string we could also loop through you know something like an array so this can be really useful and that's one of the basics of for loops in Python and I also want to show you guys one more example just while we're here so why don't we go ahead and print out a range up to five right so this will just be a simple program you can use all sorts of logic inside of these for loops so let's say that I wanted to do something special on the first iteration of the loop so I could say if index is equal to zero and if the index is zero then we know it's the first iteration of the loop so I can do something special I could like print out first iteration and then otherwise we could just print like not first so this would be an example of like maybe you want to do something on the first iteration of the loop and do something else on subsequent iteration so if I play this you'll see only on the first iteration is it printing this out and otherwise it's printing out other stuff so you know don't be afraid to put some complex logic inside of these four loops because it can really make your programs more powerful 


in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to build an exponent function now an exponent function is basically going to allow us to take a certain number and raise it to a specific power so in Python there's actually a really easy way to do this I can come down here and I can print we can say like 2 and we can just do two multiplication signs and I can say 3 and this is basically just gonna be 2 raised to the 3rd power so you can see here I can just print this out and we get 8 cuz that's 2 cubed so it's really easy to do exponents in Python but I want to show you guys how we can use something like a for loop in order to create a function like this of our own so we'll actually create an exponent function that will basically do this and we'll use for loops to do it so let's create a function so I'm just gonna say def and now we need to give this function a name so why don't we call it raised to power and inside of here I'm gonna accept two parameters the first parameter is gonna be the base number and then the second parameter is gonna be the power number so we're gonna take the base number and raise it to the power number so over here we can just make a colon now inside of this function we need to start writing some code here's the thing inside the function we don't necessarily know the value of this poem right for example if we knew that we were just trying to like square this number or cube this number I could just return like base num times base num right that would square the number or I could cube the number base num so right so this would be like the number cubed the problem is though we don't know like right off the bat what this value is gonna be right this could change like the user can decide that so in order to write this function we're actually going to need to use a for loop and I'm going to show you guys how we can use a for loop to basically figure this out so the first thing I want to do is create a variable and I'm just going to call it result and we're just gonna set result equal to 1 so we're gonna start this off at 1 now I want to create a four loop so I'm basically just gonna say four and over here I basically want to specify like a index so I'm going to say index in and now I want to specify a range and a range will basically rain just through a collection of numbers so basically I want to multiply the base num by itself as many times as the pound um specifies right so over here I can just make this a range of POW num right and so will basically loop through this for loop as many times as Panem so if pound um is two will loop through it twice if Panem is four will loop through it four times and every time through the loop will multiply bass numb by itself or actually you'll see we're gonna multiply it by this result and so down here inside of this for loop I can basically say result is equal to result times bass num this should actually give us everything we need to take this number to the specific power so the actual like result you know of doing the math is gonna get stored inside of this result variable so the first time through the loop were just multiplying bass numb by one right and so now result is gonna become the same value as bass num the second time through the loop so this would be if we were squaring the number we're basically multiplying result by bass num again so it's essentially just bass num times bass num the third time through the loop we're multiplying result times bass num so we're essentially just like cubing the number so that's essentially what this four loop is doing for us so the last thing I want to do is right here below this four loop I'm just gonna return the result so we'll be able to return whatever the result of raising the number to the power was all right so let's come down after this function and we're just gonna call it so I'm just gonna say actually we'll print out the answer so I'm gonna say raise to power and inside of these parentheses remember we can pass two numbers so let's raise three to the second power so we're just gonna square three and we'll see how this works around the program and you can see down here in the console we're getting nine let's try something a little bit crazier let's try three to the fourth power and we'll run this and we get 81 so that's three to the fourth power let's try two to the third power and we're getting eight yes and that makes sense so all raise the power function is working just as expected and I'll just walk you guys through it one more time so inside of this function we're taking in two pieces of input we're taking in a base number and we're taking in a POW number so that's like the base number is gonna be taken to the power number I'm defining a variable here called result and result is where we're gonna store the actual result of doing the math now we specify this for loop and I'm basically saying that I want to loop through this range of numbers when I put pound I'm here it's basically gonna range from 0 all the way up to but not including the power number so well basically loop through power number of times if that makes sense and then every time through the loop we're just multiplying result by base number and then we're just returning results so that's the basics of building a power function and obviously like if you're just trying to take a number to a power in Python it's really easy but this kind of shows you like the internal workings right for a function like that to work we would have to actually type something out just like this 



In this tutorial I want to talk to you about two different concepts in Python it's gonna be a pretty cool lesson first thing I want to show you guys though are two-dimensional lists so down here in our Python file I just want to create a basic list so I'm just gonna call this number grid and I'm just gonna set this equal to a normal list right just like this now normally if we were creating a list I could just put in a bunch of attributes and bunch of elements right and now all these elements are inside of this number grid list everybody's happy but another thing I can do is I can make all of the elements inside of this number grid list lists so the first item in the number grid list is gonna be a list the second item in the number grid lists is gonna be a list excetera so I'm gonna show you guys how to do that I can basically just come down here and when I would normally put the first element in the list I can just create another array so I'm just gonna make an opening close square bracket and now I'm just gonna say 1 2 3 and I can create the next item in my list I can say 4 5 6 and let's make another item in this list I can say 7 8 9 and finally we're gonna put one more list inside of the number grid list and it's just gonna have zero in it so inside of this number grid list right this high-level overall list we have four elements and all of those elements are themselves lists so essentially what we're doing is we're creating a grid right this grid has one two three four rows and one two three columns right four rows three columns and that's kind of like why these can be useful is we can create a grid like structure inside of Python using two-dimensional lists so this is a pretty cool list structure and I want to show you guys how it can access individual elements inside of this list structure so for example let's say I wanted to print one of these values let's say I wanted to print out this one right here the way I can access it is by saying number grid and the first thing I want to do is make an open and close square brackets and in here I want to put the index of the row that I want to access so this would be like row zero because that's the zeroth element in the array this would be Row 1 it's at index position 1 this would be Row 2 Row 3 etc so I could put row 0 and now right next to this I'm gonna make another square bracket and I want to put the index of the column so this would be like column 1 column 2 column 3 so I'm gonna put another 0 because this is at the 0th index of this first array so I put 0 0 here now we can print this guy out to the screen and you'll see down here that we get that 1 so I could also do this for like for this 8 for example so this is going to be 0 1 2 it's gonna be row 2 and column 1 and now we should be able to print out that 8 so that's basically how we can access elements inside of this 2d list the next thing I want to show you guys is a nested for loop nested for loop is a situation like I said where we have a for loop inside of a for loop and I'll show you how we can use this nested for loop in order to print out all the elements inside of this array so I basically show you guys how to parse through a two-dimensional list or a two-dimensional array alright so basically we're just gonna create a normal for loop so I'm gonna say 4 and I'm just gonna say row in number grid and I'm using the word row here because I'm kind of seeing these guys as rows right these are sort of horizontal rows and our little grid so for each of those rows for each of the elements inside of number grid I want to loop through so I could actually just print out each row right now and it's just gonna print out all the rows inside of this list so you can see down here we basically just get exactly what we have up there but I want to be able to access each of these individually attributes inside of each of these array elements so we can actually create another for loop and I'm gonna put that for loop inside of here so now I'm gonna say for column in row and basically what this is going to give us is each individual column or each individual element inside of these arrays so for example inside of the arrays that are the elements of the number grid hopefully that makes sense so down here now I can just print out column and this should actually print out every single value inside of this two-dimensional array so let's go ahead and run this program and down here you'll see that we're basically printing out one all the way down to zero so we're printing out all of the elements inside of all of the arrays inside of the number grid so that's how we can use two-dimensional lists and nested for-loops together and both of those things are actually pretty handy in Python 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to build a basic translator in Python so essentially we can take in a string so we can take in like a phrase or a word and we'll be able to translate it into a different language so over here I have this little file and it basically specifies this language that I made up so I'm calling it the draft language and in the draft language all vowels become G so if I was gonna translate an English word into a draft word for example the word dog I would look through the word dog in any instances where there was a vowel so in our case let's just say a e i o ru i would convert that vowel into a G so dog would map to D GG cat would get mapped into C GT so those are the basic translation rules obviously this is a pretty simple language but you get the point any vowel is going to become a G and then we'll get the draft language so we're gonna build a draft translator over here in our Python file let's start making this translator the first thing I'm gonna do is just define a translate function so I'm gonna make a function here and I'm just gonna call it translate and inside of these parentheses we want this to take one piece of information which is gonna be the phrase that we want to translate so I'm just gonna say phrase and now inside of this function we need to figure out like okay how can we translate English into our draft language well remember the rules is basically just any vowels become G's so the first thing I want to do is create a variable and this variable is going to be the translation so this will be like the final result that we're gonna return to the user so I can say translation for now I'm just gonna set it equal to the empty string so this is just gonna be like a completely empty string it's not gonna be doing anything and now what we want to do is we basically want to loop through every letter inside of this phrase and if it's a vowel we want to change tooji and if it's not a vowel we want to leave it alone and we're essentially going to be looping through phrase and we're gonna be adding the letters on to this translation one by one so let me show you guys how we can do this I'm gonna make a for loop so I'm going to say for and I'm just gonna say a letter in phrase and so now when I loop through here I can access each individual letter inside of the phrase that they passed in so what I want to do is I want to check to see if the letter is a vowel or not right if it's a vowel then we can add a G onto translation if it's not a vowel then we can just add on whatever letter it was onto translation anyway so I'm gonna use this if statement I'm gonna say if and there's actually this special thing we can do in Python we can check to see if something is in something else so I can say if letter in and over here I'm just gonna type out all the vowels so we'll say AEIOU and AE IOU so I'm basically checking to see if the letter is inside of this string and if the letter is inside of here then we know that it's a vowel so down here we can handle that case so I can say translation is equal to translation plus G because if this letter is a vowel we just want to convert it into a gene otherwise though I can basically just say translation is equal to translation plus letter so in the case where we have a vowel I'm adding a G onto translation and the case where we don't have a vowel I'm just adding on whatever letter it was onto translation so finally down below this for loop we just want to return the translation so I'm just gonna say return translation and now we have a awesome translate function and it should probably work so let's come down here and we'll test it out so why don't we allow a user to input some in so I'm basically gonna call this function actually we're gonna print it out so we'll print this out and I'm gonna call this function translate and inside of here I'm actually just gonna pass whatever the user inputs so I can just say input and inside of these parentheses I can say the prompt so enter a phrase and so now I'm basically combining all these statements together I'm saying I want to print out the translation of whatever the user enters in so let's go ahead and run this program and we'll see how we do so I'm gonna run the program it says enter a phrase actually let me format this a little bit better okay all right so it says enter a phrase so let's go ahead and do that so let's just type in the example we used before I'm going to say dog and so now out pops the answer which is dgg so that's kind of cool and then we can just keep running this as many times as we want so I could type in like to be or not to be so this is like a little bit longer of a string and you can see it translates it into our draft language so that's basically how we can create our little translator app and that's pretty cool so you can see we're using a for loop in combination with an if loop and that's a really powerful structure and actually there's one place over here where we can make this a little bit more efficient so instead of saying if letter in this string you'll notice here I'm checking to see if it's in all the lower case and the upper case I could actually just say if letter dot lower in and now I only have to type out the lowercase letters and it's still gonna do the same exact thing so that's a little like hack or whatever that we could use and there's also one more problem with this program so you'll notice down here we're setting the translation equal to the translation plus G but the problem is if I was to start my word inside of the phrase with a capital vowel so in other words if I said like you'll notice that when this gets printed out it gets printed out as lowercase GN so it's not keeping our uppercase syntax and that's kind of a problem so we can actually use another if statement in here and we could check to see if letter dot is upper and if the letter is uppercase then we can just set the translation equal to the translation plus a capital G otherwise we can just set it equal to the lowercase G so now we're able to control both of those situations so let's just test this and see if it works enter a phrase say on and now we're keeping that capital letter so those are just a couple different ways that we could make this program a little bit better but the basic concept is we have a for loop and then we have some if loops inside of it and we're calling this awesome function that can translate a word for us 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about comments in Python this is gonna be a pretty short tutorial I just want to give you guys an overview of what comments are and how we can use them in our Python programs so over here in my Python program I just have this line here it says print comments are fun so if I run my program down here inside of the console it's gonna print out comments are fun right so any code that I put over here is gonna get executed by Python but there's actually a special line of code that we can write and it's called a comment and a comment is basically a line inside of our Python file that's just not gonna get rendered by Python so when python sees it it's just gonna ignore it it's not gonna execute it it's not gonna print anything out it's just gonna kind of ignore it and comments are basically just used for us humans so a comment is used for like me or another developer to write a little comment a little like plain text you know comment inside of a file so in order to create a comment I could use this hashtag symbol so I can click hashtag and now I am writing a comment so I can write whatever I wanted in here I could say like this program is cool and you'll notice when I run the program that doesn't show up anywhere right it doesn't matter what I put after this hashtag this is just like ignored by Python it's just for me or another developer to come in here and use so a lot of times if you want to write like a little note inside of your Python files or maybe you can write yourself a little reminder or if you want to write a line to like explain a line of code so for example I could write a comment that would explain this print statement so I could say like this prints out a string right now anybody looking at my file would be able to read this and they'd be like oh that's what this does okay cool so comments are useful for leaving little comments in a Python file if you want to make comments on multiple lines you can just create a new line and use another hashtag and so that I could type out whatever my next comment was I mean generally if you're gonna put comments on multiple lines you want to just use multiple hashtags but there's actually another way that you can write out comments so you can use a triple quotation mark so I'm typing out the single quote and I'm typing it out three times so you can see here up here we have this three times we have this three times so in here I can you know write any comment that I wanted so I could put you know it's much text up here as I would want and same thing when I run this program it's just not gonna get rendered so this is another way to make multiple line comments but the official Python like style guides or whatever just recommends that if you're gonna put comments on multiple lines you use these hashtags so you know you can really do whatever you want but if you want to be like super Python official then use these hashtags comments can also be useful for doing something called commenting out a line of code a lot of times when you're writing a program you might have a line of code in there that is maybe like potentially messing stuff up and so what you can do is you can actually comment out that line of code so I could put a comment in front of this line of code and now when I run my program the program is gonna run but it's not gonna use this line so sometimes if you're trying to see if like a line of code is causing you trouble or if you want to see what your program would be like without a line of code or even like a block of code you can just comment it out and that way you're not actually deleting the code from your file you're just commenting it out so python is gonna ignore it and those are really the two uses for comments it's to write little notes write little comments about different things or to comment out code and as you go forward in Python I'm sure you'll find uses for comments 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about catching errors in Python a lot of times when we're running Python programs you'll encounter different errors so a different situation just could come up and your program might throw an error or it might throw an exception and a lot of times when these situations happen they'll completely stop your program from running and what we can actually do is we can watch out for you know certain specific errors that are gonna pop up in our program and we can actually handle them so instead of our program just breaking and stop executing we can actually handle those errors and do things when they occur so I want to show you guys an example of using this down here I'm saying number is equal to int input enter a number basically what's happening is I'm prompting the user to enter in a number using this input command and then I'm converting whatever they entered into an integer so as long as they enter in like a valid integer I can convert it into an integer so I can convert it into like a whole number and I can store it inside of this number variable then I'm just printing it out so let's try to execute this program I'm gonna run the program and you'll see down here it says enter a number so we can enter in like 4 for example and when I answer in 4 everything's gonna work and it's just gonna print out 4 and everything is right in the world and actually I'm gonna modify this up here so it's a little easier to see but let's say we run the program again so it says ok enter your number let's say that I break the rules and I don't enter a number so I just ignore what the prompt says and I put you know some random text in here now when I enter this the program is gonna throw an error you can see down here it says value error invalid literal for int base with base 10 basically hey you didn't answer in an integer like you said you would right we told them to enter in a number they entered in text so it broke the program and this is a situation that happens a lot so there's a lot of different situations where something can just go wrong in our program and I'm until now we've just kind of accepted it as a reality but if you're writing a real live Python program you don't want something like this to trip up your program you don't want the entire program to break when somebody just forgets to enter in a number right you want to be able to handle all these different situations and in order to handle them we can use something called a try accept block and a try accept block will basically allow your program to try out a piece of code and if everything goes well then we're great like we could try out entering in the number and if the user enters in the correct number great but if they don't enter in the correct number then we can basically like account for that so they entered in something like a string when they're supposed to enter in a number we could tell them like hey you entered in the wrong thing so I'm gonna show you guys how we can use these try/except blocks I'm gonna come up here and I'm just gonna say try I'm gonna make it : and I want to indent both of these things so both of these things are gonna be inside of this try block now I'm gonna make a new line I'm gonna come down here and I'm just going to type out accept and I'm also gonna put a colon here and down here I'm just gonna print something out so I'll just say like invalid input so now since I put this code inside of this try block if the user enters in something wrong it's going to be able to catch it so it'll be able to catch what the user does wrong and print out invalid input onto the screen so let's go ahead and run our program and it's just gonna say enter a number so we're gonna ignore that we'll enter this in and now instead of yelling at us and breaking the program it just says hey invalid input so it was able to handle the error that got called it was able to handle the invalid input error basically just told us hey no more input so this is a really powerful thing that we can do in our Python programs basically just to protect our programs right if I want to have my program running for long periods of time I can't have something as simple as an invalid input trip it up so I can catch that invalid input using these try accept blocks but here's the thing you'll notice that this little guy down here is getting highlighted and let's just see what it has to say so it's basically saying two broad exception clause and this is a message that we're getting because when I just say accept this will catch any error under the Sun so anything we can go wrong in my program from most part this is gonna accept it so let me give you guys an example let's say I had in my program I was creating a variable right so I wanted to create a variable called value and I set it equal to 10 divided by 0 now if you know anything about math you'll know that you can't divide a number by 0 it's not possible so the program isn't going to be able to handle this and you'll see that this is gonna throw an error for us so when I run the program it basically says zero division error division by zero we're not allowed to do that right if I took this and I put this down inside of this try block and I just pasted it in here it's gonna get caught by this exception that we wrote down here so it's gonna get caught by that except so when I run the program you'll see it says invalid input but the problem is that we didn't input something that was invalid right we just divided by 0 but it wasn't able to handle that right so it could not divide by 0 it threw an error so even though we didn't get an invalid input even though it was because we divided by 0 it still printed this out and this brings me up to another point is we can actually catch or we can accept specific types of errors so for example in this case we got a division by 0 error in this case we got an invalid input error right we put something in that was wrong it couldn't convert the value so I can create 2 different except blocks to catch two different types of errors so down here I'm gonna just make a space and I can specify the type of error that I want to catch so when we divided by 0 it was 0 division error so if I just put 0 division error in here now it's gonna catch that 0 division error so I can say divided by 0 I can also make another except so I could say except and we can catch the other exception that we got so I think it was a value error right it was we put in the wrong type of value inside of that input so now we can print out invalid input so with these two except blocks we're basically able to handle both of these situations so for example if this ends up breaking the program this division by zero then it'll be able to catch that so down here it'll tell us hey you divided by zero but if I was to get rid of this line of code and I just entered in the number wrong so I came down here and I entered in a string set of a number now it's gonna tell us invalid input so we're gonna be able to specify what happens when certain things break so when we get a valid when we get a value error we can say invalid input when we get a zero division error we can say divided by zero so depending on what breaks depending on what happens we can actually do different things and I want to show you guys one more thing we can do which is we can actually store this error as a variable so I can say except I can say as and I can type in a name here so a lot of times people will just say like eerr and down here I can print out the actual error so I could just print eerr and so if we end up dividing by zero so if I say answer is equal to 10 divided by zero we're gonna throw this error and it's gonna print out what went wrong so now I can run this program and it just says division by zero so it just printed out the error that we got so that's another useful thing you can do is you can actually like print out the specific error of the got thrown now a best practice in Python is to use these specific errors so you always want to accept and except for a specific error what you don't want to do is just say accept and then just accept anything under the Sun it's just too broad and it's not a good practice in Python it's you always want to be catching specific errors like this 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about reading from external files in Python now a lot of times in Python you're gonna want to read from files that are outside of your Python file so you might want to read information from like a text file or a CSV file or like an HTML file and you can actually use something called the Python read command and it will allow you to read a file that is stored outside of your Python file so you can use these files to get information or you can parse through different files and do different things so I'm gonna show you guys the basics of reading files opening files closing files doing all that stuff over here I have this file called employees dot txt and it basically just lists out a bunch of different employees like these could be employees in an office or whatever so it's just listing out all of this information so let's say that inside of my app dot python file i wanted to read the employees inside of that file the first thing i have to do is actually open that file from inside of python so i can use a special command called open so i can say open and then in here i can type in the name of the file that i want to open so this is either gonna be a relative path to the file an absolute path to the file or just the files name if both files are in the same directory so in my case app dot python and employees dot txt are in the same folder like they're in the same directory so i can just type out the name of the file I can just say employees dot txt and now I want to put one more thing inside of this open function and it's gonna be the mode that I want to open the file in so you can actually open files in a couple different modes and the first mode is called read so I can just put an R here and that's gonna stand for a read and this basically means that I only want to read the information inside the file I don't want to modify it I don't want to change it I just want to read it I just want to see what's in the file and do some stuff with that information another mode it's called write so I can type in this and writing basically means that you can change the file write you can write new information you can change existing information there's another one called a and a stands for append and this basically means that you can append information on to the end of the file so you can't modify any of the information in the file you can't change any of the information but you can add new information and there's one more which is our plus and this basically means read and write so this will give you all the power of reading and writing so in our case we're just going to be working with regular AAR's so we're gonna be reading from the file now this open function will essentially just open the file so it's gonna like go over to that file inside of our file system open it up and it'll allow us to read through it but generally we're gonna want to store this opened file inside of a variable so I can create a variable and we can just call it employee file and I'm just gonna set it equal to this open function so now the open employees txt file and all the content inside of it is stored inside of this employee file variable now whenever you open a file you always want to make sure that you close the file as well so just like we have this open command we also have an close function so I can come down here and say employee file dot close and this is essentially just going to close the file so we're no longer gonna be able to access it and generally it's a good idea whenever you're opening up a file you want to also make sure that you're closing the file at some point so generally once you're done reading it you can just close it so that's kind of like how we can open and close a file now let's talk about how we can get information from the file right there's no point in having the file that if we can't figure out what's in it so there's actually a few different functions that we can use on this employee file to figure out what's inside of it and I'm gonna show you guys some of those so I'm just gonna make a print statement and inside this print statement will basically just print out some information about the employee file so the most basic thing we can print out is just the entire contents of the file but before I do that I want to show you guys how you can check to make sure that a file is readable so before we do anything else generally it's a good idea to make sure that it's possible to read this file and there's a function inside of Python we can use called readable so I'm just going to type out employee file dot readable and this is going to return a boolean value and it's gonna tell us whether or not we can read from this file so I'm gonna run my program and you'll see down here we get a value of true and that's because we set the file with a read mode so it's in read mode we can read from it if I was to put a W here so if I put like right now readable is gonna be false because we can no longer read the file we can only write to the file so I'm going to change this back to R so we can just read it so once you figure out whether or not the file can be read from let's actually read it so there's another function called employee file read and this is basically just gonna spit out all the information in the files so when I run the program it's just gonna spit out all of this information write all the information that was in that file I can also come down here and we can read an individual line inside this file so I could say employee file dot read line and what this is gonna do is it's gonna read an individual line inside of this file so now when I run this program you'll see it's just reading that first line in the file and this red line function is actually just reading the first line and then it's basically like moving a little cursor onto the next line so if I was to copy this line of code and then print it again down here I'm saying employee file read line so it's gonna read the first line and then when I say it again it's gonna read the line after that so this is actually gonna end up printing out the first two lines in the file when I run this program you'll see we print out Jim salesman and Dwight salesman so if I were to do this multiple times like I could technically print out every line inside of this file and you can see we can do that and so that can be pretty useful for reading multiple lines in a file but there's actually another function that is better at doing that we can say instead of employee file read line we can say dot read lines and what this is gonna do is it's gonna take all of the lines inside of our file and put them inside of an array and so now when I print this out you'll see we have this array down here that says Jim salesman that's the first item in the array Dwight salesman's the second item in the array it's basically taking each line and putting it inside of an array so if I wanted to access a specific line I can just refer to it by its index in the array so if I said one now this is going to give us that Dwight salesman line because that is at index position one inside of the array you can also use this read lines function with a for loop so I can come up here and create a for loop I'm just gonna say for and we'll say employee in employee file and then for each employee we just want to print them out so and actually sorry we have to put employee file dot read lines up here and so now this will loop through all of the employees in this employee file dot read lines array so we can actually just print out the individual employee and now this will print out all the employees inside of that file so it's basically printing out each line in the file and that can be pretty useful so you can use all of these different functions like read read line read lines readable you know there's a bunch of these different things that we can do to get information from a file and so there's a lot of cases where you're gonna want to be able to parse through information in a file and this is a awesome way to do it so just to recap whenever you want to open a file and read from it you can just use this open function type in the name of the file and then the mode which in our case is gonna be R then you can do all sorts of stuff with it and you always want to make sure that you close it when you're done that's just good practice so that's the basics of reading from files and hopefully you guys can use this in some way shape or form in the future 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about writing and appending to files in Python so one of the cool things about Python is it allows you to work with external files so I could have like an external text file and I could actually like completely read all the information in it I could parse through it use that information to do certain things but in addition to reading a file I could also write a file and that's what I want to talk to you guys about today is writing new files and appending on to existing files over here I basically just have some code written out and this essentially just reads information from this employees dot txt file so you can see over here I'm specifying the mode which is R and that stands for read and then down here I'm just reading all of the contents of the file and spitting it out on the screen so I'm gonna click the play button over here and you'll see that if this executes so it's printing out all of the lines of code in our text file so over here I'm in this employees text file and it just has all this information like employees in an office but let's say that I wanted to add another employee onto here right let's say that a new employee joined our company so we wanted to add them onto this list well I can come over here to my app python file and instead of reading from the file i want to append it to the file so i want to say a and appending to the file basically basically means that you're adding some text at the end of the file so wherever the file ends you're just going to add some text onto there so what we can do is we can actually add another employee into the file so instead of printing something out I'm actually just gonna say employee file dot right and when I say employee files out right I'm gonna be able to write something to the end of the file so I can basically just write whatever I want so why don't we add in another employee into our employees text file so we can add in another employee why don't we say like Toby and he's gonna be in Human Resources so now when I run this program it's gonna add Toby Human Resources on to the end of the file so I'm gonna run my program and you'll see that nothing shows up down here in the console but if I go over to my employees dot text file all the sudden we have a new entry over here it's Toby from Human Resources right so I was able to append a line on to the end of this file but here's the thing you need to be careful when you're writing to files because you can actually mess up a file very easily for example I already added Toby here into my file but if I was to run this program again you'll see that over here in this employees dot text file it went ahead and added Toby again right so it added this employee here again and also you'll notice that in this case this employee didn't go on to the next line I accidentally ran my file again and all of a sudden it messed up this file over here and so a pending you really need to be careful because if you actually run your file again or if you you know append something on something wrong to the file it's permanent like it's getting saved inside of the file so I want to talk to you guys a little bit more about you know appending another thing we could do let's say we wanted to add another employee and you'll notice over here in this employees dot text file when I appended it on again it got appended to the end of the existing line right so the first time I had a new line there but if you don't have a new line at the end of your file and you all and you want to add a new line you're gonna have to add some special characters so let's add another employee and we'll call her Kelly and let's just say Kelly is in customer service so Kelly is gonna be in customer service and if I want to add this employee on to the end of the file in a new line I'm gonna have to put a new line character in front of it so I can say backslash n and this will append this entry into the file with a new line so on a new line so now when I run this you'll see we get Kelly from customer service on her own line so you want to make sure that you're aware of like these special characters that you can use they call them scape characters and you know anytime you're adding on to a file you want to make sure that you're adding on exactly where you want to add on so in addition to appending to a file I can also just like overwrite a file or I could write an entirely new file so since we already have this open instead of appending to the file why don't we just write a file so I'm gonna use this W and now if I say employee file dot right because I'm using W and I'm not using a it's actually gonna override the entire file and it's only gonna put this inside the file so when I run this and we go over to this employees dot txt file you'll see we only have one line inside of this file now it's just Kelley customer service that's because I was using W not a and when you use W it's just overriding everything that's in that existing file you can also use W to create a new file so over here I could say employee file is equal to employees one dot txt and now what's gonna happen is when I run this it's gonna create another file for me so I'm gonna run this and you'll see over here in my file browser we have this new file employees 1 dot txt so if I open this up it has exactly the same stuff as in this employee's file but it basically created a new file for us and so a lot of times you're gonna want to create a new file and you can use different extensions too so if I wanted to create like a webpage I could say index.html and I could also add in some HTML code in here so if you don't understand HTML don't worry about it but if you do I could put like a paragraph in here another paragraph like this is HTML basically HTML is like a web page and the point I'm trying to make is that you could write out a web page inside of Python by doing something like this so now when I played this we get this index.html file and it has some HTML inside of it so that's one way that writing to files can be really useful you can overwrite an existing file you can write a new file and create it or you can append on to the end of and there's tons of applications for writing to files and Python is a great language for working with reading writing and doing all that stuff with files 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using modules in Python now a module is essentially just a Python file that we can import into our current Python file so for example if I wrote a Python file that had a bunch of like useful functions or useful variables or you know other things like that I can take that file I could import it into the file I'm currently working on and I can actually access all of those functions all of those variables all this stuff from that external file inside the file that I'm currently working on so I'm gonna show you guys how we can use modules and we'll talk about like you know where you can find awesome modules and really why modules make Python and awesome language so over here in my text editor I actually created this file and it's called useful tools dot Python and basically this file just has a bunch of sort of like useful tools that I might want to use in one of my programs so you'll see over here I have some variables this one is telling me how many feet are in a mile this one's telling me how many meters are in a kilometer and then we have this list here which lists out all of the members of the beetles I also have a couple different functions down here so I have this get file extension function and this basically just will you know you give it a file name it'll tell you what the extension is and then we have this other function down here which simulates rolling a dice so you pass it a number if I pass it like a six it would roll a 6-sided dice my passes a nine it roll and I'd sided dice etc so this is like a Python file that I wrote and it has some useful stuff in it and honestly there's a lot of stuff in here that I might want to use in the other Python files that I work with so let's say I'm over here at this app dot Python file and I'm thinking to myself huh I think I could use one of those functions that was inside of that useful tools file actually yeah I need to simulate rolling a dice in my program well instead of having to go over here copy this function and then paste it over here into my program I can actually just import this useful tools file and I'll be able to import all of these functions and all of these variables and attributes so the way I can do that is just by coming up here and I'm just gonna go right at the top of my file and I'm just gonna say import and then I want to type in the name of the file that I want to import so I'm just gonna say useful underscore tools and Python is gonna be smart enough to know that it should go off and grab all the stuff from this useful tools dot Pi file so once I've used that import statement I can actually use all of the functions inside of that useful tools file so for example I could simulate rolling a dice I could say useful tools dot and now I'm actually able to access all of the attributes from inside that file so when I say useful tools dot you'll see down here in my little suggestions menu it's telling me like Beatles feet and miles get file extension meters and kilometers rolled dice so it's giving me access to all of the stuff that was in that file so over here I could just say like roll dice and we could pass this like a ten we'll roll a 10-sided dice and now this should actually be able to run that function so we'll simulate rolling a 10-sided dice so you can see we got four and this is a really core concept in Python which is importing functionality from external Python files and this is like huge in Python and this is seriously gonna change the way that you create your Python files so you'll notice like I didn't have to copy any functions or any variables or anything over into this file and yet I was able to use all this stuff that was inside this useful tools file so that is huge and honestly it's going to save you a lot of time because you can write something once and then you can import it into your other files and so that's really the basics of using modules I mean modules are very simple a module is just any external Python file that you want to use some stuff inside of it I want to show you guys a place where you can go to find a huge list of modules so I'm gonna go over here to my web browser and I'm on this website it's actually like the official I found docks and basically all I did to get here was just type in list of Python modules in Google and depending on the version of Python you're using you're gonna want to make sure that you click the right one I clicked on the version 31 and over here on this page you can see there's just a huge list of Python modules and these are basically modules inside of Python that you can just access so essentially there's like all of this awesome code that's already been written for you and so if there's some sort of functionality that you want to have inside of your Python program chances are there's a module in here that has that functionality so there's all sorts of stuff you can do I mean if you just look through this list like you'll see a huge collection of basically just you know a bunch of either Python variables or Python functions just you know things that you can use to make your programs better so here's what I would recommend like head over to this page and just sort of look through a lot of these different modules you know see what you can see and honestly like if you click on one of them it'll bring you to a page that talks about like how to use it it'll tell you like how to import it and just you know some basics about it and this is sort of like the list that's on the official Python Doc's but here's the other thing the Python community is huge there's tons of developers who use Python and you can actually find a lot of third-party modules so if you just go online and you know look up like Python module for doing X or Python module for doing Y chances are somebody out there has already written a Python module to do what you're trying to do so if you get good at using modules and you get good at you know looking for them and finding them you can actually save yourself a bunch of time because chances are that somebody's already written a module to do you know what you're trying to do or like part of what you're trying to do so now that we've taken a look at all these different Python modules I wanna just kind of dive in a little bit deeper into how we can actually use these things so you'll notice here there's a lot of files right there's a lot of different modules that we apparently have access to in Python but the question is where are all these files stored right when I was over here in my program for example I was using this useful tools dot PI file like I knew where that was I created that file I was directly involved in making it and I just imported it over here it was pretty easy right but what about all of these files right what about all these modules over here like where are all of these stored and there's basically two types of modules here there's built in modules which means they're just built into the Python language so we kind of automatically have access to them and there's external modules and a lot of these external modules are just stored in basically the same folder that we installed Python on our computer so for example let's look at a couple of these right we have like base64 bdb been ASCII like if I come over here and you'll see I'm over here in my little File Explorer I have my Python project which is draft there's also this other folder over here called external libraries if I was to click down on this and I come down here you can see it's just the version of Python that I'm using there's a folder here called Lib and this is a very important folder this is basically storing all of those external modules so you can see if I scroll down here we have all of these different like modules right so here's that base 64 here's BDB right a lot of these external modules are stored inside of this Lib folder and like I said there's external modules there's also a few modules that are just like built-in modules they're not gonna be stored inside of here and you can actually tell so for example if I was to come over here and click on base 64 it tells me where the source code is so the source codes in Lib forward slash base 64 we were able to see that right I was I saw that inside of my limp folder this been ASCII though for example if I click on this you'll notice that this isn't giving me a folder cuz this is basically just like built into Python so we don't have to worry about you know locating that file it's just kind of like it just kind of works so some of these are external some of them are built-in and I want to show you guys in addition to you these modules right so there's a lot of good stuff here and honestly you can spend you know years and years just learning about all these different modules but a lot of times you're gonna want to use modules that other people have written and you know there's a lot of developers who work on Python and who write different modules so there's a lot of useful modules out there that aren't included in this list right they're not gonna be inside of this lib folder by default and what we can actually do is we can install those external modules those third-party modules that don't just come pre-installed with Python and I'm gonna show you guys how to do that really quick so the first thing you need to do obviously is find a Python module that you want to install the alum download and I have actually used one in the past Python Docs it's a external module that you can use to basically use Python to create Word documents which is pretty cool so you can like format Word documents inside of it so I'm just gonna look that up here in Google I'm just gonna type in Python Docs and like here's the thing there's tons of these external modules you don't have to use Python Docs I'm just giving you guys an example but really if you just look up like useful third-party Python modules there's gonna be lists of hundreds of these things online in my case though Python Docs has a website and it basically just has like some installation instructions I'm gonna come over here and it tells me that I can install Python Docs using the command pip install Python Docs so this brings us to something I want to talk to you guys about which is PIP and PIP is essentially a program and actually if you have a newer version of Python 3 it comes pre-installed with Python 3 and you can use PIP to install Python modules it's referred to as a package manager and a package manager basically just allows you to like install manage update and uninstall like different Python modules so pip is extremely useful and in order for us to install Python Docs we're gonna have to use pip so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that what I want to do is open up the command prompt or the terminal on my computer if you're on a Mac you want to open up your terminal if you're on a Windows computer you want to open up your command prompt I'm using a Windows right now so I'm just gonna come down to the search bar and type in CMD and this command prompt should come up so I'm gonna click this inside of the command prompt we can actually use pip the first thing we want to do is just check to make sure that pips installed and like I said if you have a newer version of Python 3 pip should come just pretty installed and it should just work in here if you don't have a newer version of python 3 though you might have to install pip separately and there's tons of instructions online on how to install pip so I'm just gonna check to make sure that I have it I'm gonna type in pip - - version and this should spit out the version of pip that I currently have so as long as we have pip then we're ready to install an external or a third-party python module all I have to do is just say pip install and now I just want to type in the name of the Python module so in the case of Python Docs it was just Python Docs like that now again you don't have to install Python dogs I'm just doing this for this tutorial just kind of show you guys how this is gonna work but you know what you want to do is go online and look up some third party external python modules and generally like I'd say 90 to 95 percent of the time you're gonna be able to just install them using pip in the off case that you can't install them using pip chances are they'll be like some detailed installation instructions but I would say for the most part any like legitimate Python module is gonna be able to install using pip so over here I'm just gonna say pip install and then the module name so Python - Docs and when I click enter this is gonna go off and install Python Docs for us so I'm just gonna enter and it's gonna go off and install everything we need for Python Docs so you can see we successfully installed Python Docs zero point eight point six so I'm gonna show you guys where exactly this got placed so normally when we install a external third-party module it's gonna get put inside of this Lib folder but it's gonna get put inside of a special folder in year called site packages so site packages is a special folder and if I open this folder you'll see now we have this Doc's folder and we also have this Python doc zero point eight point six pi three point six egg info folder so these two folders are basically included in that module installation so you can see this Doc's folder has a bunch of different Python files and has a bunch of stuff in here that we can use so if I wanted to use this inside of one of my programs I'm just gonna refer to the name of the module so in our case it's just gonna be Doc's so I used Python Docs in order to install it but we're gonna use Doc's if we want to import it so I could come up here and I could say import do see X and now I can actually use it so I can just say like Doc's dot whatever and you can see there's a bunch of different stuff down here there's like a document document part image part there's a bunch of stuff that we can use with this and obviously depending on the Python module you install there's gonna be different instructions but you can see it got stored down here in this site packages folder if I wanted to remove this I can use pip to do it so I could just say pip uninstall and we could just again say the module name so python dogs and pip will now uninstall this on our computer so if I was to go back over to this folder you'll see that those two that Doc's folder and then that other folder disappeared so they're no longer here and I'm actually not going to be able to use this anymore so that's sort of the ins and outs of using modules now again there's tons of these modules and I can make dozens and dozens of Python courses covering each one of these modules you know the built in modules the the modules that are included by default and external modules there's tons of these things out there and really as a Python programmer now what you can do is you can go out and play around with these different modules I showed you the ins and outs of installing them and you can use pip to install all these different modules and you know you can make sure that you have them by checking the site packages for the libs folder but really now it's on you to just kind of go out and use these modules and don't shy away from this because modules are a huge part of Python and you're definitely gonna want to include them in your Python stack 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about classes and objects in Python now classes and objects are extremely useful in Python programming and they can help you to make your programs more organized and more powerful so when we're in Python we're dealing with all types of data right and a lot of times when we're writing programs we're gonna have to work with different types of data and there's essentially like a few basic types of data we can do if usually things like strings so like plain text numbers and boolean values those three are kind of like the main types of data that you're gonna be working with in Python and we have all sorts of structures we can use to store that data you know things like lists or dictionaries but here's the problem is that not all information not all data and not all things can be represented using strings numbers or boolean right there's a lot of things in the real world that we can't represent in something like a string or or just a number right in other words something like think of like something like a phone or a computer or a person right you can't really represent those things in like a string or a number you know in other words like the data types that we have available to us and Python can't cover that and so what we can do with classes and objects is we can essentially create our own data types so I can create my own data type for anything I want in Python so I could create like a phone datatype and it can represent a phone so I could store all the information I would ever want to know about my phone inside of that data type and in Python we could create a class for it and essentially what a class is is it's just saying hey here's another data type that we want to use in Python so with a class you can essentially define your own data type and it's super awesome classes are extremely useful classes are used in almost every single major programming language out there so in this tutorial I just want to give you guys a basic introduction of classes and using them inside of Python so let's say that I'm writing a program I want to represent a student inside of this program so maybe I'm writing a program for like a college or a university let's say that in this program I want to model a student like I want to model a real world object and I want it to be a student right well we don't have a student data type and I can't really represent a student in just a single string or a number so what I can actually do is I can create a class for a student and I'm basically creating like a student data type so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that and create our student class so over here I'm just gonna make a new file we'll just make it a new Python file so I'm just gonna call it student dot PI and inside of this student dot PI file I want to create a student class so the way that I can do that is just by typing class and now I want to type the name of the class that I want to create so in our case we're gonna create a class called students so I'm just gonna say student and now we're gonna make a colon now everything that goes inside of here is going to be inside of our student class so everything that's indented like this will be considered a part of our student class and basically what we can do inside of this student class is we can define a bunch of attributes about a student so essentially what I'm doing is I'm like modeling a student I'm creating our student data type and I can use things like strings integers and boolean in order to map out what a student should be and what a student should have so I want to create something called an initialize function and the way I do that is just by typing out d EF and I'm just gonna type two underscores and then the word ini T and then two more underscores and you also want to type out open and close parentheses and inside of those parentheses we want to type out self and then we want to colon after that what I can do inside of this initialize function is I can basically map out what attributes a student should have so we can essentially define like hey here's the student data type in Python so what I want to do is add in sir attributes after this self so I'm just gonna say self a comma and now we can start thinking about you know what values will represent a student inside of our Python program so if I'm thinking like I'm thinking something like name right so every student in our program should have a name they also might want to have a major because they're in college they probably also will have a GPA so they're a grade point average like how they're doing in school and let's define one more thing let me think why don't we make a boolean and it's gonna be called is on probation and this will basically tell whether or not the student is on probation so essentially what I'm doing inside of this initialized method inside of this init function is I'm defining what a student is in our program and so in this program a student has a name it has a major it has a GPA and it has a value that determines whether or not it's on probation this right here is the student data type so if I'm representing a student inside of my program now it has all of these attributes associated to it and that's basically what I'm doing up here now inside of this initialize function we actually have to do something and basically what I want to do is assign some values so I'm gonna be writing out some stuff and this might not make total sense right now but this is gonna make sense in a second after we create our first student object so just stick with me right now and just basically know that we have to do what I'm doing over here so I'm just gonna say self dot name is equal to name and then I'm gonna say self dot major is equal to major self dot GPA is equal to GPA and I'm gonna say self dot is on probation is equal to is on probation so again this might not make a whole lot of sense right now but in a little bit this is gonna make total sense so now that I have this student class defined I can actually use this class inside of my other files so I'm gonna come over here into this a Python file and this is just my main file so I actually want to create a student right so in that student class we defined the student data type and we basically said like hey a student has a name a major a GPA and it says whether or not they're on probation that's like the template for what a student is but we can actually create a student so we can create an actual student and give it some information and that's called an object so this student class over here is basically defining what a student is so a class is just like an overview of what the student data type is an object is an actual student so it's an actual student with a name a major and a GPA it's not just this template anymore it's actually like a student that we're representing inside of our program so in order to use that student class and create a student object I actually need to import that so all I have to do over here is just say from student and this is referring to this student file I can say import student and basically what this is saying is from the student file I want to import this student class so even though these are both student they're referring to different things so this is referring to the file and this is referring to the actual student class so now as we did this we can create a student so so you can create an object of a class a lot like you would a normal variable so I can just give it a name I'm gonna call this student 1 and I'm just gonna set it equal to student and I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis and now inside of this parenthesis I want to give this student a name a major a GPA and an is on probation value so I'm gonna say we'll just create a fake student so I ought to say his name is Jim and he's studying business and we want to give him a GPA so maybe he has like a 3.1 and finally we want to say whether or not this student is on probation so why don't we say false so basically what I'm doing is I'm saying that I want to create a student so I want to actually create a student object and remember an object is just an instance of a class so the class is like an overall template it defines what a student is but an object is an actual student with actual information so we could call student one now this is a student object so I just want to show you guys what this student object actually is and what we can do with it and then I'm gonna talk some more about that init function from before so over here I'm just gonna make a print statement and inside of here I just want to print out student and what's cool about this student one object is I can actually access each of the attributes from inside of this object so if I wanted to get the name of the student I could say student 1 dot name and now this is actually going to print out the student's name so over here you'll see it prints out Jim if I wanted I could print out the student's GPA and it's gonna print out the students GPA 3.1 so now that I created this student object I can actually access the information about the student so essentially I've just created a student data type so I could create as many of these students as I wanted if I wanted I could create another student we could call it student 2 and essentially we do the same thing we just give it different information so we could say like Pam and her major is art and she has like a 2.5 and let's say that she is on probation so now I have another student student 2 so if I wanted I could access information about that student we could say like student 2 GPA and now this has given me the GPA of student 2 so basically what I did was I created a student data type and I created student objects and now I'm able to represent a student inside of my program so let's talk real quick about all this stuff over here because I didn't really explain it basically what's happening is when I come over here and I say student and I'm passing in all of these different values those are getting passed into this init function so remember I passed in a name I passed in a major I passed in a GPA when we create that student we're actually calling this function and when I pass in the name the major in the GPA those values are actually getting stored over here in this name this major this GPA etc right so I'm giving this student object all of that information and down here what I'm doing is I'm saying self name is equal to name and basically what this means is the actual objects name is going to be equal to the name that they passed in so self dot name is an attribute of student right so the student is storing a name the student is storing a major the student is storing a GPA but that's different from this name this major in this GPA remember these are all just values that I passed in there just parameters and so I need to take the values that I passed in and I need to assign them to the actual attributes of the object so I need to say okay the name of the student is going to be equal to the name that we passed in one more time the name of the student object is going to be equal to the name that we passed in the name of the student's major is going to be equal to the major that we passed in the students GPA is going to be equal to the GPA that we passed in that's basically what's happening here so when I say self it's referring to the actual object so over here when I'm creating this student object I'm giving it all of this information it's taking that information and storing it as attributes for the object so hopefully that makes sense I think that's about as clear as I can make it but the point is that now we have a student data type so now I can represent a student inside of my Python program and that's like super powerful and what's cool about classes and objects is you can do this with anything so in this example we created a student class and then we created student objects off of that but I can model any real-world entity into this program I can model something like a phone or I can model like a water bottle or I can model you know a keyboard right I can model anything that I wanted inside of my program I can just give it certain attributes right and so that's what's cool about classes is we can model real world objects and we can create our own data types 


in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to build a multiple-choice quiz in Python so basically we're gonna set up a little multiple-choice quiz and we'll have the user take the quiz and as they take the quiz we'll keep track of their score and then at the end we'll tell them how they did so this is gonna be a pretty cool video I'm excited to show you guys how to do this and we'll get to use things like classes and if statements and loops in order to build this program so we're gonna use a lot of cool stuff in Python the first thing I want to show you guys I actually did this before I started the video it's this little array it's called question prompts and I basically just wrote out all the questions that are gonna be or I shouldn't say the questions I wrote out all the question prompts that are gonna be inside of my multiple-choice quiz so the first one just says what color are apples and the answers are red purple or orange the next one is what color bananas the options are teal magenta and yellow and the third question is what color are strawberries and the options are yellow red and blue so this is obviously a very very easy multiple-choice quiz but I just kind of wrote out the questions beforehand so I didn't have to spend time doing that so let's talk about how we can build a multiple choice test well the first thing I want to think about is how can I represent the questions in the test right over here we have the question prompts but there's actually two parts to a question when you think about it there's the prompts in other words like the actual question itself and then there's the answer to the question and both of those attributes need to be kept track of right I need to keep track of what we want to ask and I need to keep track of what the answer is so what I'm actually gonna do is create a question class so I'm going to create a little data type for questions and inside of that question class will be able to store the question prompts and will also be able to store the questions answer so I'm just gonna come over here to my folder and I'm gonna make a new Python file and we're just gonna call this question da py so we'll call it question dot pi and inside of this question dot PI file I'm going to to class so I'm just gonna say class question and I'm gonna put a colon here so inside of this question class we want to define it and initialize function so I'm gonna say def two underscores in it two underscores and then we're going to type out an open and close parentheses self and then a colon so after this self we wanted to find the different attributes that will describe or that will be included in a question so we're gonna include a prompt and we're gonna include an answer so every question will have a question prompt and a question answer and now down here I want to take those values and assign them to the actual class object so I'm gonna say self dot prompt is equal to prompt and I'm gonna say self dot answer is equal to answer so now we have a question class setup and we can store all the information we need about a question so what I want to do now is go back over to my app Python file and we're actually going to create an array of questions so I have over here these three prompts and I'm actually just gonna create another array so we'll just call it questions and I'm just gonna set it equal to two open and close square brackets and we're gonna start creating question objects so I can just say the first element in this questions array will be a question and we want to pass question prompts zero and the answer to the first question was a red green that's the color of Apple so I'm gonna pass that first question and I'm also going to pass the answer which is a and you'll see down here I'm getting an error so saying unresolved reference question so actually what we need to do before we can create these questions is we need to import this question class so I'm gonna come up in here come up here and say from question import question so now down here in this questions array we're not getting that error anymore so we created one question object and I'm just gonna create a couple more for these other ones I'm just gonna copy this one and we will paste this down here alright so now we're creating two other questions and these ones are gonna be one and two and the answer to the second question is C and the answer to the third question I think it's V let me look yeah so it's CMB alright so essentially what we're doing is we're creating three questions each one is getting a different question prompt and they're each getting different answers so now we have an array of questions that we want to ask on our tests so the next step is to actually write a function that will run the test right it has to ask the user the questions and it has to check to see if they got the answer right so down here lower in the file let's create a function so I'm just gonna say def and we'll call this run test and inside of this parentheses we're gonna take one parameter into this function we're gonna take a list of questions so I'm just gonna say questions so this is basically going to be a list of question objects that we want to ask the user so once I'm in here all I want to do is loop through all the questions so I want to loop through each question I want to ask it to the user I want to get the users answer and I want to check to see if it's right and we need to be able to keep track of how the user does through the test so I want to create a variable called score and I'm just gonna set it equal to zero so every time the user answers a question right we'll increment this score variable all right so what I want to do is like I said loop through all the questions and that questions array so I'm gonna create a for loop I'm gonna say for question in questions so in other words for each question object inside of this questions array I want to do something and basically the first thing I want to do is ask the user the question and I want to store their response inside of a variable so I'm gonna say I'm gonna make a variable down here called answer and this is gonna represent the user's answer to the and I'm gonna set it equal to input and I need to give this a prompt so I'm actually gonna give this the prompt for the question so I can just say question dot prompt so now I have the answer that the user entered in which is stored inside this variable so we want to check to see if they got the question right and I can do that using an if statement so I could say if answer and this refers to the students answer is equal to question dot answer so I'm checking to see if the answer that the student gave is equal to the answer of the current question that we're asking and if this is true then I just want to increment score so I'm gonna say score plus equals one and this basically just means we're adding one to the score so the last thing I want to do inside of this function is just print out the result so I want to print out how the user did so down here I'm just gonna say print and I'm basically just gonna print out like hey you got like two out of three questions or you got five out of six questions right or you got zero out of ten questions right we'll just print out how they did so I'll just say you got and now I want to print out how many questions they got right so this is just gonna be the score and in order to print a number alongside of a string like this I'm gonna have to say STR and then type in the number so we'll say STR score so we'll basically say you got however many they got right out of so we'll use this little forward slash and now we'll just say how many questions there were so we can say and again we're gonna have to convert this to a string because it's gonna be a number so we can say string and then we want to figure out how many questions were in that questions array so I can say le n and inside of here we can just say questions so this is kind of like this long statement just to print out how many questions that were so that over here I'll just say correct all right so now we have this print statement and it's just gonna be printing out how many questions they got right so let's see if this works the last thing I need to do is just call this run test function so I'll say run test and I'm just gonna pass it that questions array that we created before so we created this questions array with all of these question objects inside of it I'm basically just gonna pass that into this run test function so now let's run our program and see how we did hopefully we don't get any errors there's a lot of code there so it's possible that we might okay so it says what color are apples huh is a tough one all right let's put a so we'll get the first question right what color are bananas let's get the second question wrong so I'm gonna say B bananas are magenta and we'll get the third question right so it says what color are strawberries I'll just put B because that's the right answer so now you'll see that our program prints out you got two out of three correct so not only did it ask us all the questions and get our input for each question but it also kept track of our score and it printed it out so why don't we run through the test one more time and we'll just like get two wrong this time so we'll get this one wrong I'll get this one wrong and I'll get this one right so now it says you got 1 out of 3 correct so it's able to actually grade our test and what's cool about the program we just wrote is if I wanted I could add another question into here and it would automatically be able to ask it so it doesn't matter how many questions we put in here it's just able to ask it so really the point I was trying to make with this whole video was just how we can use something like a class in order to model a real-world entity so for example we created this question class and we were able to store all the information about a question that we could ever need so we were able to store like the prompt and the answer so we created our own question data type and then we were able to create a bunch of different questions pass it into this run test method and it was able to grade the test and just run the test really easily so that's kind of the point so hopefully this makes sense you know this was a lot of code so if you don't fully understand what I did go back watch the video you know tried a couple times on your own and see if you can create your own multiple choice test 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about class functions in Python so a class function is essentially a function that we can use inside of a class and it can either modify the objects of that class or it can give us specific information about those objects over here I have this student dot PI a file and inside of here I created a student class so I just had a class student and I gave this student a couple of different attributes I gave it a name a major and a GPA so I can give this student all of this information so when I create a student object it'll have all of that information in it now over here on this app dot PI file it actually created two students so student one is Oscar who is studying accounting and he has a GPA of three point one student two is Phyllis who's studying business and she has a three point eight so what we can actually do is we can use functions inside of these class files so I could actually define a function inside of this student class and then all of my student objects could access it so for example I can come down here and create a function and let's say we wanted to create a function that told us whether or not this particular student had honors so whether or not they were on the honor roll right basically like our today like a really good student so I could define a function called on honor roll and basically what it's gonna do it's going to tell me whether or not this particular student is on the honor roll and let's basically just say the rules are being on honor roll is you have to have a GPA of 3.5 or above so here GPA is 3.5 or above that means you're on the honor roll well over here I could actually write the code for that so I could say if self dot GPA and when I say self over here this is referring to like the actual student's GPA and you'll notice over here I have to pass that in as a per and that always has to be the first parameter so I could say if self GPA is greater than or equal to three point five then we can return true because this student is on the honor roll otherwise else we can just return false because if their GPA isn't above a 3.5 then they're not on the honor roll so that's essentially our little on honor roll function and you can see it's a very small function but it provides a service to the objects of this class right it allows the objects of this class to figure out whether or not that current student is on the honor roll so over in this app dot pie file I could just print out that value so I could say print and I'm gonna see if student 1 is on the honor roll so now when I run this you'll see it should print out false and it's putting out false down here because student 1 only has a GPA of 3.1 if I was to do the same thing on student to students who has a GPA of 3.8 so we should return true and that's exactly what happened so essentially a class function is just a little function that can be used by the objects of the class and I would say this is a pretty good example of like what a class function should be doing should be like giving us information about the class or it could also be like modifying information about the class so that's the basics of using functions in classes I mean this is a pretty simple tutorial but I really just wanted to introduce you guys to the concept of putting functions inside of classes this is gonna be really useful and if you're making a class you always want to think about like what functions can I put inside of here that will you know essentially help the user to either figure out information about the object or modify different values in the object 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about inheritance in Python now inheritance is basically where we can define a bunch of attributes and functions and things inside of a class and then we can create another class and we can inherit all of those attributes so I could basically have one class that has all the functionality of another class without having to physically write out any of the same methods or attributes so if that's confusing don't worry I'm gonna show you guys exactly what this is in this video so let me show you about some stuff I have set up over here I created this class called chef and over here we just have this class chef and inside of this chef class we have three functions so this chef can do three things the chef can make chicken the chef can make salad and the chef can make a special dish and whenever the chef makes a dish he basically just says the chef makes a chicken or the chef makes a salad or the chef makes barbecue ribs for this special dish it's basically just saying whatever the chef is doing so if I was to come over here to my app Python file you'll notice that I'm importing the chef so I'm basically allowed to use this chef class now and I can say my chef is equal to chef so I'm creating a new chef so now if I came down here and I said my chef make chicken when I run my program now it's gonna say the chef makes a chicken if I said make special dish and I run the program now it's gonna say the chef makes barbecue ribs because that's the chef's special dish so I have this really awesome chef class and it works really well but let's say that I wanted to create another class to model another type of Chef right so this chef class is just modeling like some generic chef right we're representing some generic chef in our program but let's say that I wanted to create a class that modeled the different of Chef for example let's say we wanted to create a class that modeled a Chinese chef so instead of just a normal chef this is a Chinese chef well I actually created a file over here called Chinese chef Python so we could actually use this Chinese chef Python file to create our Chinese chef class so I'm just gonna say class and over here I'm just gonna say Chinese chef and basically I just can define everything that the Chinese chef can do but let's say that our Chinese chef can do everything that our generic chef can do so the Chinese chef is like a special chef right it's very specific type of chef but let's say that this Chinese chef can do everything that the normal chef can do so the Chinese chef can make chicken can make salad and can also make a special dish well if I wanted to give this Chinese chef all of that functionality I could just come over here and I could copy all of these functions and I could paste them in here and so now the Chinese chef can do everything that the other chef can do but let's say that in addition to all of these things the Chinese chef can also make a special dish called fried rice so I could say def and we could say make fried rice so the Chinese chef has this extra function which allows it to make fried rice and over here we could just say the chef makes fried rice and let's also say that the Chinese chef has a different special dish so instead of making barbecue ribs the Chinese chef makes orange chicken alright so now we have our Chinese chef class set up and you'll notice that it can do everything that the normal chef could do so let's go back over to our app dot python file and I want to create a Chinese chef object so instead of importing from chef we're gonna just import from Chinese chef so I'll say Chinese chef and we're gonna import Chinese chef so let's go ahead and make a Chinese chef object so down here I'm gonna make one and I'll just say my and then my Chinese chef we can print out this special dish so remember the Chinese chef can do everything that the normal chef could do so if I say my Chinese chef makes special dish when I run this program you'll see the regular chef is making barbecue ribs and the Chinese chef is making orange chicken so everything works out and this Chinese chef also has an extra method called make fried rice and you can also make fried rice but here's the problem right when I go over here to this Chinese chef pie I when I wanted to use all of the functionality that was inside this chef class I actually had to copy and physically paste all of these functions down into this file right and that's kind of a drag I mean especially like imagine if this chef had like 20 or 30 of these different functions in it oh I have to copy and I'd have to paste all of those inside of this Chinese chef and this is where we can use something called inheritance so instead of having to copy and paste all of these functions I could just inherit these functions from that chef class and in order to do that I can actually just get rid of all of these and I can come over here and right next to where I'm saying class Chinese chef inside of parentheses I can say the name of the class that I want to inherit from so I could just say chef and I'm also gonna have to import this so I'm gonna come over here and we'll say from chef and pour chef so basically what this is saying is inside of this Chinese chef I want to be able to use all of the functions that are contained inside of the chef class so I'll say that one more time inside of this Chinese chef class I want to be able to use all of the functions that are inside of this chef class so by using inheritance here I'm actually able to come over here to this app top pie file and now I'm still able to execute for example like the make chicken function even though I didn't specify the make chicken function in here I didn't write it out I can still run this program and the Chinese stuff the Chinese chef will still be able to make chicken so when I run this program you'll see down here it says the chef makes chicken and that's because I inherited the make chicken method from the chef class but here's one thing that got messed up if I come over here and I say make special dish remember the Chinese chef special dish was supposed to be orange chicken but now the Chinese chef is gonna be making barbecue ribs because I inherited this make special dish function from this chef class and so what I can actually do is I could come in here and I could override that make special dish class so I could say def make special dish and down here I can just override it so I could say the chef makes orange chicken and now when I go over here and I run this make special dish function now the chef's gonna be back to making orange chicken so the Chinese chef will make his special dish so that's basically what inheritance does it allows me to inherit functionality from an existing class into the new class and I can actually just inherit all of it without having to write it out so I didn't have to write out make chicken and make salad inside the Chinese class but the Chinese chef can still make chicken and salad because it inherited that functionality from the chef class 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about the Python interpreter the Python interpreter is basically a little environment that we can use to execute Python commands so it's kind of like this little sandbox environment where we can test out and try out different Python commands or different Python functions in a very safe and neutral environment so it's kind of like a quick and dirty way to write Python and try different things out the way we use the Python interpreter is by open up opening up our command prompt now if you're on Windows there's a program called command prompt if you're on Mac there's a program called terminal basically you need to open that program in order to use the Python interpreter so I'm here on a Mac but if you're on a Windows you can essentially do exactly what I'm doing just inside of the command prompt so on Mac here I'm just gonna search for my terminal if you're on Windows you can just search for like CMD or command prompt and it should pop up so the terminal is basically an environment on our computer where we can interact with the computer and do different things without a graphical user interface so normally when we interact with a computer we're using things like buttons or you know windows and you know where we can move stuff around we can you know basically just like interact with the computer with graphics but the terminal or the command prompt is a place where we can interact with the computer using text commands so you know I'm not gonna get too much into it what the terminal and the command prompt are but that's essentially what it is so inside of here we can use the Python interpreter and the Python interpreter is basically just a little program that like I said we can write you know sort of Python in so generally all you have to do is go over to your terminal or your command prompt and type in Python 3 and since we're using Python 3 I'm going to type Python 3 but you can also just type normal Python and I'm pretty sure that gives you python 2 now here's a quick disclaimer on Windows you may run into a problem where you can't use this Python three command and it's possible that if you're running into that problem Python like Python three hasn't been added to your Windows path variable and basically what that means is your computer doesn't recognize the command Python 3 and that's the case all you have to do is just go and Google how to add Python 3 to your Windows path variable it's really easy I'm not gonna get into it in this video just because it's kind of outside the scope but if you're running into that problem that's probably it's not on your Windows path variable so just google around for that and you should be able to find an answer but I'm gonna cite Python 3 and I'm gonna click enter and it's gonna open up this cool little thing down here so you can see it basically just says like here's the version of Python now I'm just gonna enter so we can have some like new lines here but down here this is the Python interpreter so we can write Python code in here and it's gonna work so I could for example I could write like print and inside of here I could print like hello world and when I click enter you'll see that it prints out hello world I could create a variable so for example I could say like num1 is equal to 10 I could say num2 is equal to 90 and then I could print out num1 plus num2 and it's gonna be able to do that for me I could also use something like a function so I could define a function in here we could make a function that is called say hi and it'll take a name parameter and you'll see here when it's aw I wanted to create a function and put these three little dots and I can indent in and we can write the code for our function so I can say like print hello plus name and now I have a function called say hi so I can break out of this by just entering again and I can call the function so I could say say hi and we'll say how to me hi Mike so now it's gonna say hello Mike so I can use a function I could use something like an if statement you know I could say I could use something like a for-loop we could use while loops I mean we can basically use all of the basic like Python commands and you know inside of this Python interpreter and like I said before it's essentially just an environment where you can test out Python code now this is not a place where you want to write like any serious Python scripts so if you're like designing and writing a Python program I would not recommend doing it inside of this interpreter it is it's not a very intuitive environment it's pretty much just setup for some quick and dirty tests like we need to test something out great this is a perfect place for it because you don't have to set up a file you don't have to use like some IDE you don't have to execute a file you just go in here it's quick it's dirty you get it done but if you're writing like an actual program you definitely definitely definitely want to use a text editor the text editor it's just gonna be way more organized everything's gonna be a lot clearer and you're not gonna get confused with like where stuff is and what you have so that's the basics of the Python interpreter you know in in the course I haven't really been using it at all just because I think it's a lot easier to teach when we're inside of a file then inside of here but you know don't count this guy out the Python interpreter is awesome a lot of people use it and it's great if you just need to test you know little bits of code out without having to set up some huge environment so python interpreter definitely awesome I would play around it you know have some fun and take advantage of it
