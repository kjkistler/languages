# Java

in this course I want to teach you guys about one of the most popular programming languages around which is called Java Java is a powerhouse programming language Java runs on literally billions of devices around the world Java is also the programming language that's used to design Android apps so there's a lot of different reasons for you guys to learn Java there's literally hundreds of jobs every day that opened up for Java and it's really just a great language to learn if you want to get your foot in the door with programming Java allows you to write super powerful programs that can do just about anything I mean a lot of devices just around your house are probably running on Java and in this course I'm gonna teach you guys everything you need to know to get started we're gonna start off by talking about like installing Java will get you up and running with the text editor we'll write our first program and then we'll get into like the meat and potatoes of Java we'll talk about things like if statements and for loops I'm gonna show you guys everything that you need to know to get started as a Java developer then later in the course we're gonna get into some more advanced Java topics we're going to talk about object-oriented programming and how Java is object oriented and how you can use Java to write huge scalable awesome programs I'm really excited to be bringing you guys this course and I'm really excited to be teaching Java because it's such an awesome programming language so stick around in the course and I'll teach you everything you need to know to get started as a Java developer 

in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about installing Java on your computer so we're actually gonna install everything that we need to create our java programs and that's gonna be something called the Java developer kit or JDK and then after we install that I also want to talk to you guys about choosing a text editor for Java so there's a bunch of different options to choose from and basically these are just like programs that will help you to write your Java programs so I'm gonna show you guys like what some of the most popular ones are and then we're actually going to install one called eclipse so the first order of business is to install the Java developer kit and it's basically just software that we need in order to start writing programs in Java so I'm gonna go over here to my web browser and I'm just basically gonna Google search JDK download and the first link should be this website Oracle com and this is where you want to download it from so basically I'm just gonna click this one and this should bring me to a page and if you want the actual URL it's Oracle com forward slash tech Network forward slash Java forward slash Java SC /downloads so this page has a couple options here and you can see here it says Java platform JDK and right now it's and version 9 that's probably gonna change if you're watching this video like far in the future but this is what we want to download so we want to download this Java platform JDK so I'm just gonna click the download button you'll see that it brings us over to this other page essentially all we have to do is just accept this license agreement and now there's a bunch of different file so I'm using a Mac so I'm gonna click the Mac option but there's options for all these different operating systems so we'll just click this guy and that should start downloading so once your download is finished I'm actually just going to head over to my downloads folder and you can just double click on the file you got and this should open up a Installer so I'm just gonna click the Installer and here we just have this like JDK installer window we can just kind of click through here and just install it on your computer once you finish the installation you can just close it and now we basically have everything that we need to start writing our Java programs so the next step is actually finding an environment work that we can write those programs so actually you can use any text editor you want to write your Java programs you could use something like TextEdit or notepad but a lot of times especially when you're just starting off with Java you want to use a special text editor called an IDE an IDE stands for integrated development environment it's basically just a special text editor that will help you to write your Java code more efficiently and it'll just kind of like help you along the way when you're writing Java so there's basically three like really popular Java IDE s out there so three popular programs that are really like targeting Java users there's one called Eclipse there's one called NetBeans and there's one called IntelliJ and off any of these programs work really well you know a lot of people use each one of them there's pros and cons to each one in this course we're going to be using a IDE called eclipse and eclipse is one of the most popular Java IDE s and it's the one that I use the most so I'm most comfortable using it and that's kind of why I'm just gonna use it in this course so if you really you know if you want to follow along exactly with everything we're doing in the course go ahead and download eclipse and I'm gonna show you how to do that in a second but if you want to try out some of those other IDE s as well there's no problem doing that you should still be able to follow along basically with what I'm doing in the course so I'm gonna show you guys how to download eclipse I'm just gonna again go over to my web browser and we can basically just type in Eclipse download and you can see here it's just eclipse.org /downloads so there's a bunch of different versions of eclipse and they give the versions different names as of right now like October 2017 when I'm filming this video the latest release is Eclipse oxygen that might change but basically you just want to download the latest version so I'll just click download 64-bit and again we just have this download link over here so that's gonna start downloading and once that download is finished we can just open it up so over here and this should bring us like this Eclipse installer so I'm going to click this and we'll open it now we should get all of these different options so there's a bunch of different options for versions of Eclipse that we can install really what you want is just Eclipse IDE for Java developers this is the most simple version of Eclipse and you don't need any of these if you're just starting off with Java so we'll just click this one and you can just click the install button now I actually already have Eclipse installed on my computer but as long as you just click that install button it's gonna install on your computer and you should be able to access it so I'm gonna go ahead and open eclipse and as long as you're able to open eclipse and everything is up and running then you should be good to go and here we get this Eclipse IDE for Java developers home screen so now that everything is installed you're ready to start writing your first Java program 


in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about setting up your first Java project in Eclipse so I'm using this Eclipse IDE so it's just like a text editor that we can use to write Java programs and I'm gonna show you guys how we can create our first Java file in here and we can get everything set up and make sure everything's working so let's go ahead and do that I just opened up Eclipse and we have this like welcome screen I'm actually just gonna get rid of this and this is kind of like the main Eclipse workspace so this is you know where we're gonna be working and here's something about Eclipse there's a lot of features in here that you're just not gonna need to use as a beginner so this program is designed for you know professional developers who are using you know extremely complex and you know complicated Java projects for our purposes though we're gonna be using it you know basically just to create a couple files so don't get too intimidated by all these different buttons and options I'll show you exactly what you need to worry about and then you can just kind of go off and you know start focusing on learning so the first thing we want to do is create something called a Java project and a Java project is basically just a place where we can store all of our Java files so I'm gonna go up here to file and I'm just gonna click new Java project and we get this little prompt up here so we can just give this a project name I'm just gonna call this draft or draft Academy and if you want you can specify where this should be saved so you can either use the default location or you can just like browse your file system and pick where you want it to be and for the most part you can just leave everything else as the default don't worry too much we're just gonna click finish down here I'm gonna click finish and eclipse is going to go off and create a project for us so over here we have this newly created draft folder and draft was the name of the project so this is now the folder for our Java project and I'm just gonna click down and you'll see that we have a couple different things here the first is this JRE system library and if you click down on this it's basically just a collection of all of these different files and these are just special files that Java is gonna use to help us run our Java programs you don't really need a word too much about that and don't get intimidated because there's so much stuff here if you just leave this here then you're gonna be fine and everything should work the next folder is a very important folder for us and it's called this source folder so it's SRC and this is essentially the folder where we're gonna store all of our Java programs so I'm just gonna click down here and you'll see we have this thing here just says default package and you're gonna see this word a lot when you're dealing with Java which is packaged and a package is essentially just a special type of folder that stores similar Java files so eventually one day when you're creating like you know dozens or hundreds of different Java files you can organize them into different packages but for now don't really worry too much about what a package is in order to create our first Java program we're actually going to have to create something called a class and a class in Java is basically just a special container that we can use to store code so we can put some Java code inside of a class and then we'll be able to execute that code so I'm just gonna right click on source I'm gonna click new and over here I'm gonna click class and this little dialog box should pop up and there's a lot of options here really all you guys need to worry about is this name option right here so I'm just gonna name my first Java class I'm just gonna call it app and down here I'm just gonna click finish so there's this finish button and we'll just click it alright so you guys will see what happened over here we have this default package and now this app dot Java file is inside of it and over here it says public class app so that's what this app dot Java file has inside of it so far so this public class app in these curly braces inside of here we can put some code now in order to get started with Java we're actually gonna have to create something called a main method and don't worry too much about what methods are right now we're gonna talk more about that as the course goes on but essentially a main method is basically a little contain that we can put inside of this class where we can store all of the code that we want to execute so any code that's inside of this main method is gonna get executed by Java so what I want to do is I just want to type out public static void main now don't worry too much about what all of this stuff is for right now we're just starting out you're not gonna understand what this is right off the bat and that's okay but just copy exactly what I'm typing here and you guys will be fine after main we're gonna type in open and close parentheses just like this and then here we're gonna type string with a capital S and then we're gonna type an open and close square bracket and we're gonna type a RGS just like that and now after this parenthesis we're gonna make an open and closed curly bracket and I'm just gonna make some new lines so now I'm inside of these open and closed curly brackets inside of this public static void method so any code that we want to execute in our Java program we're gonna put inside of here so right now I'm just gonna show you guys a simple line of code that we can use to write something out onto a screen called a console so just follow along with me we're just gonna type out sys TEM system with a capital s dot out dot PR IM tln and then we're gonna make an open and close parenthesis and after this open and close parenthesis we're gonna make a semicolon so there's a couple things I want to talk to you guys about here system dot out dot println and this would normally be said system dot out dot print line this is a special Java command which will print something out to what's called a console and a console is basically just a little window where we can output information so we get output text out onto the console and basically that's when you're starting off with Java that's how you'll sort of figure out how your programs are doing and what they're doing you'll print stuff out to this console and this command here will allow us to do that and every time you write a line of Java code you always need to end it with semicolon so you'll see here we have this semicolon and no matter what whenever you write like a command inside of Java you need to end it off with that semicolon that's very important and when you're starting off trust me you're gonna forget to do that everybody does and that's one of the things that people often complain about with Java is you have to do that but there's actually a valid reason for it now inside of these parentheses I can put some quotation marks and inside of these quotation marks I'm just gonna type out hello world so what I want to do now is I want to save this and what's gonna happen is we're basically going to print out to that console whatever text is inside of these parentheses so we're gonna print out hello world and what I want to do to run this program is I want to come over here and you'll see in Eclipse there's this green button right here this play button now there's also two other buttons that look very similar you want to click the bigger button the one that says run app so you're just gonna click this play button and I'm actually going to show you what happens so I'm gonna click the play button and you'll notice that down here hello world has gotten printed out so there's this little window down here and I can actually just make it a little bit bigger or smaller and down here we were able to print out hello world and you'll see here this just says console so there's a bunch of different tabs over here really all you guys need to worry about is this console tab so anything that I type out with system dot out dot print line is gonna show up down here in the console now you can keep the console down here at the bottom if you're using eclipse or you can also move it around the screen I usually like to put it up here on the side so all I'm doing is I'm just taking I'm clicking it and I'm dragging it and I'm just gonna move it all the way to the side and I can put it over here on the side that's usually how I prefer to have it so that's probably how we're gonna have it set up for the rest of the course but you know you can move it wherever you want a lot of people do prefer to have it there at the bottom so that's the basics of setting up our java file now again a lot of this stuff isn't gonna make sense to you you know like what is this public static void main thing what is this string args like don't worry too much about that right now this is all just stuff that we needed to put in here in order to you know start using Java and all that's going to be explained as we go through this course so stick with it and in the next few tutorials we're gonna start really ramping up with Java and we'll learn how we can write some awesome programs so if you guys notice over here inside of my little text editor the text is colored differently than it is by default so normally when you first install Eclipse it's just sort of like this white text and it looks pretty good but a lot of times what developers will want to do is give their files different themes so if you want to do that I'll show you how you can do that in Eclipse if you're using a different text editor than this video might not apply but just know that I mean in any text editor you're gonna be able to use themes so in Eclipse you want to head up here to this help tab up at the top and I want to go down to this Eclipse marketplace so I'm gonna click this and this is going to open up this special window for the Eclipse marketplace and this is basically just a place where we can stall all sorts of add-ons so up here in the search bar you just want to search for theme and probably what's gonna come up first is this Eclipse color theme a little widget and you can see it has 1.4 million installs so this is really popular all you have to do is come over here and just click the install button and this is gonna start installing it you're gonna have to accept a license agreement and you might get this security warning you can just install it anyway now eclipse is actually gonna have to restart so you can just click restart now it's gonna load Eclipse backup and now once Eclipse is loaded back up all we have to do is come up here and you just want to open up the settings or the Preferences so if you're on Mac you can just click preferences if you're on Windows just click settings and down here just go down to this general tab and appearance and then just say color theme and so now you should have all of these different themes here that you can use and you can preview them so if you just click on different themes it'll show you like what they're gonna look like in your text editor and then when you find one you like just come down here and click apply and it'll apply to your text editor so that's one way that you can give yourself some different options for coloring on your Eclipse IDE 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about writing some basic code in Java so we're just gonna write a few lines of code I'm gonna talk to you guys about how that code basically gets executed we're gonna look at the order that things get executed in and we're actually going to draw out a little shape onto the console so it's gonna be kind of cool and the first thing I want to do is just talk to you guys about the order that Java code gets executed in so when we have our Java code basically what happens is Java goes through and it executes each individual line of code that we write so imagine that you were writing like a recipe for someone right and you had a bunch of instructions listed out on the recipe when that person goes to follow the recipe they start with step one and then when they're finished with step one they move on to step two step three step four etc so they follow the steps in other words they execute the steps in the recipe in order and that's exactly the same thing with computer programming and Java so when we write out Java code we're writing out sets of instructions and Java is just gonna follow those instructions in the order that we write them so I want to show you guys how we can draw out a little shape onto the console over here and it'll kind of give you a sense of the order that this java code gets written in and sort of like the flow that our programs are gonna follow so I'm over here in this public static void main method and remember this is the method that is going to get executed by Java so any code that we write in here when we click this Run button up here it's gonna get executed so let's go ahead and start writing some code I'm gonna basically write some code to draw out a triangle onto the screen so we're actually gonna be drawing a little shape here and the way that we can draw something out onto the screen and when I say screen I'm just referring to this console window over here we can use a special Java command called system dot out dot print line so what this is going to do is it's gonna print out a line of text onto that console over there and inside of these parentheses we can just put some quotation marks and now whatever we put inside of these quotation marks is going to show up on the screen so what I'm going to do is I'm actually copy a few of these so we're gonna make four of these and we're gonna be able to draw out a pretty cool triangle shape onto the screen so let's go ahead and start drawing our triangle I'm actually just gonna start by drawing some forward slashes so at the bottom one we'll put a forward slash there and this one will put a forward slash there here we'll put a forward slash there and here we'll put a forward slash there so I'm kind of drawing this like diagonal shape here and now I'm just gonna draw vertical lines all the way down and actually in here why don't we put some underscores so now we have this basic triangle and what's gonna happen is when I run this program Java is gonna go it's gonna see okay here's the first instruction that I'm given it's telling me to print something out onto the screen and it wants to print this right here so this is like the top the point of our triangle so Java is gonna draw this out and then it's gonna go on to the next line of code so it's gonna say okay what do we need to do next all right we need to print out another line and we're gonna be printing out the text that's in here it's gonna keep doing that until it goes through all of these instructions and once it gets to the end and there's no more instructions then our program is going to be done running so let's go and we'll run the code so I'm going to click this Run button over here click this and I'll just click OK and now you can see over here on the screen we have this little triangle so it's a pretty good-looking triangle right it looks exactly like we had it over there on the screen but the point is is that java drew out all of these individual lines in the order that we specified them so it didn't draw this line first it drew this line first then this one then this one so I could actually modify this triangle imagine I took the base of the triangle and put it up here now this is gonna get drawn first and these are gonna get drawn after it so we'll have a different looking triangle and you can see now we have this kind of like funky looking shape over here so that's kind of the basics of one drawing stuff out onto the screen and you can see we can use this print line function right here and that's basically just gonna draw out whatever we put inside of these parenthesis onto the screen and then we'll make a new line and we also learned about executing code in order so the order that we put the code in here is the order that Java is going to look through it and the order that it's gonna execute it so that's like the bare-bones basics of writing a program in Java and as we learn more about Java you're gonna figure out awesome ways that you can make it something like this even more powerful 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using variables in Java a variables are basically little containers where we can store specific values or pieces of data in our Java programs so whenever you're writing a program especially in Java you're going to be working with a lot of data you know these can be pieces of information like numbers or text and a lot of times it's going to be useful to store that data in containers and there's a special type of container that we can use in Java which is called a variable so in this tutorial I'm just gonna gonna walk you guys through what variables are how to use them and why they're useful in our programs over here I have this little program and you can see it's right here and I've basically written out a little story and I want to read this story to you guys it's a really cool story basically says there once was a man named George he was 70 years old he really liked the name George but didn't like being 70 most of his friends were also 70 and one of them was also named George so this is a very simple story but I'm gonna show you how we can use variables to make this story a lot better so over here we have our code to write out this story and I'm basically just using these system dot out dot print lines and I have about five of them here and inside of each one I'm writing a line of the story so you can see here's the first line here's the second line and this is a great way to do this right I'm able to write out the story it shows up on our console here's the thing though let's say that I'm looking at this story and I'm thinking to myself hmm I think I could make this story a little bit better I want to appeal to a broader audience why don't we make the character a little bit younger right so instead of George being 70 let's say I wanted to make George be 40 well all you have to do to do that is just go through and change the age so I'll come in here instead of saying 70 we'll replace it with 40 and then I gotta find the next place okay so over here it says 70 we'll replace this with 40 and over here again it says 70 so let's put 40 and that looks pretty good now George is a little bit younger but let's say that I don't like the name George so I want to change the name maybe we'll make this character named Tom okay so now I just need to go change the name so I'll go here okay here's one I'll change that to Tom here it is again we'll change it to Tom and here we go last one change this to Tom so now I've successfully updated my program and we made the character a little bit younger and we changed their name so now when I print this out you'll see we have our new and improved story over here on the console here's the problem though when I wanted to go through and change the character's age and the character's name I had to physically search through each line on here find where either the name was or the age was and change it manually and that's kind of a drag right I mean this is a pretty short story but imagine I had like this long huge story that mentioned the character's name like hundreds of times and mentioned their age hundreds of times if I wanted to change it and be a real pain in the butt we can actually use something in Java to make this a little bit easier and that's called a variable so we can take this age value and we can take this name value and we can store it inside of a container which is called a variable and then instead of having to type out the age and the name inside of our story we can just access the variable or the container that we store that value in and we can just use that throughout our story then if I wanted to change the name or the age I would just have to change the value in one spot where we defined our container and it's gonna make this a lot easier so let me show you guys how to do that I'm gonna come down and write above this print line I'm just gonna make what's called a variable and the first thing we want to do is make a variable for the guy's name so the character in our story I want to create a container where we can store their name and generally in Java if you want to store a piece of text so this person's name is going to be like text right we want to create a variable called string and a string is just a type of variable and it stores textual information so I can say it's string and now what I want to do is I want to type out the name of the variable that I want to create so we can actually give this a descriptive name so I'm gonna call this character name and now I'm gonna set this equal to a particular value so why don't we set this equal to the character's name which is Tom and now after every line of Java code I always want to put a semicolon so what's happening here is I'm defining the type of data that I want to store inside of my variable in our case it's gonna be a string which again is just like a piece of text like this I'm giving this variable a name so I'm calling it character name and then I'm giving it a value so I'm saying equals Tom so now the character name variable has a value of Tom what I can also do is create another variable for his age we could store his age inside of a string but there's actually a special data type in Java which we can use to store numbers and it's called an integer so an integer is just like a counting number so be like 1 2 3 4 5 etc it's any of like the whole numbers so if I want to create an integer I can say int and again I want to give this a descriptive name so I can say character age because this is gonna represent the character's age now I can say equals and I can put the value so if I'm defining a number like an integer in Java I don't have to put quotation marks around it I can just type out the number like that so now over here we're saying the type of data that we want to store inside of our variable which is an integer and then we're giving that variable a name and we're giving it a value which is gonna be 40 now what I can do is I can come down to my story and I can actually access these variable names instead of just typing out the values so over here for example we have this character's name Tom what I can do is I can replace this with that variable and the way that we can do that is by inserting the variable into here and if I'm doing that inside of a string right here all I have to do is use a plus sign that we can add in that variable name so I'm gonna get rid of this quotation mark and over here I'm just gonna use a quotation mark so you'll see here my text editor has colored these differently so this is colored green and then when I end the quotation mark here we're no longer like typing out actual text I can do a plus sign and now what this is going to say is there once it was a man named a space and then it's gonna say the actual character's name so over here we can just type in the name of the variable that we created so I can say character name so this is actually going to go up here and it's gonna get the value out of this character named variable so let's test this out I'm gonna save my file and I'm gonna run this program and now let's look over here on our console you'll see we have there once was a man named Tom so I didn't actually type out Tom over here in my print line statement all I did was access the character name variable and when Java saw this what it did is it went up to the character name variable it grabbed the value and it inserted it in here into the text and so that's basically how we can insert the character's name without actually having to type it out so I could basically just copy this and I can use this every time we want to access the character's name so I'm just gonna copy this and we'll find the next place where it says Tom so down here we're also accessing the character's name so I'm just gonna get rid of this and I'm basically gonna put two quotation marks here two plus signs and inside of here we'll just type out character name so let me also just explain what's happening here we're defining a literal like line of text so it's just the name and then when I end this quotation mark so you can see here we have a starting quotation marks and an ending quotation marks once I end off that quotation marks I can use this plus sign and I can add in a variable so now this is just gonna variable it's not going to be like text inside of quotation marks and then I can use this other plus sign and I can use quotation marks again so that's kind of how you can insert a variable into like a line of text like we have here so there's one instance with the character name and I think we have one more place the app so down here we're also accessing the character's name so now when I save my file and I go and run my program over here everything looks the same so it's still saying that once was a man named Tom he really liked the name Tom but didn't like being 40 most of his friends are also 40 and one of them was also named Tom so we're able to access that same value without actually having to physically write it out in each one of those lines and what's cool about using variables is if I wanted to change the character's name so let's say I wanted to change it to Dave all I have to do is change it up here in other words I can just change what we're putting up here and now it's automatically gonna get updated throughout our entire story so now instead of using the name Tom it's gonna use the name Dave in all of these locations and that's really why these variables are awesome is because you can store a value in one spot you can define the value in one spot and then you can access it in any number of spots just by accessing that name and if you want to update it you only have to change it in one spot so I could also do the same thing for the character's age so over here I have character name we could do the same thing for character age and we can also like control that so I'm gonna do that really quick so I went through and I added in this character age variable wherever we were accessing the character's age and this is just gonna be 40 so you see that it's still gonna work over here we're still able to access the character's age and if I wanted to change it so let's change it to like 20 it's gonna automatically update throughout our entire story so now I can change the character's name and the character's age super easily and it'll automatically update in my story now there's actually another thing we can do we can assign differ values to these variables at different points in our program so if I came down here and I'll just make a new line after this these first two system dot out dot print lines I could actually change the value of these two variables and so I could say character name is equal to Mike and I can say character age is equal to 80 and so what you'll see is on these first two lines of the story the character's name is going to be dave and the character's age is gonna be 20 but after I give these variables different values down here for the rest of the story their age and their name is gonna change so let's see how this works I'm gonna run the program and let's check out our story it says there once was a man named Dave he was 20 years old he really liked the name Mike but didn't like being 80 so from this point in the story down to this point in the story the character's name has changed and the characters age has changed so in certain times in your program you're gonna want to update those individual variables and you can do it just like we did it over here just by saying the variable name and equal sign and giving it a new value so that's the basics of using variables and in the next video I'm gonna talk to you about what types of variables we can create so up here we created a string which is just characters and we also created an integer but there's a bunch of other types of data that we can also create so I want to show you guys all the different types of data that you can store inside of your programs



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about data types in Java now a data type is basically just a type of data that we can work with inside of our Java program and Java as a programming language gives us certain types of data that we can represent inside of it and generally when we're talking about data types we're also going to be talking about variables and a variable is just a container where we can store a piece of data and we can create different variables that are designed to hold different data types so I'm gonna walk you guys through what the basic data types are we're not going to cover all of them because there's a lot of sort of obscure data types but I'm gonna show you guys the most useful and the most common data types and you'll be able to start using them in your java programs down here we're just gonna create a few different variables and we're gonna create different variables that store different types of data so the first type of data that we can store in Java is a string and a string is basically just a collection of characters that are sort of like strung together so it's any sort of like textual information so I can create a variable and I can just create string and I'm just gonna call this phrase so I'm defining the type of data I want to store inside of my variable and then I'm telling Java the name of this variable and now I can just give it a value so I can say to be or not to be so this is like our little phrase and what I can do is I can actually print this variable out inside of this print line so I can just say phrase so all I have to do is type out the name of the variable that I want to access and when Java sees this it's basically just gonna say okay what value is stored inside of the phrase variable I'm gonna print that out to the screen so you can see over here on the screen when I run my program it prints out to be or not to be awesome seems to be working we can also create other variables with different types of data so another really popular type of data to store it in java are numbers right any type of numbers if doing something with math you're gonna need numbers if you're representing something like an age you're gonna need a number so why don't we create a variable now in Java and really just in general there's two different types of numbers the first type are called whole numbers a lot of people also call them integers these are basically counting numbers so if I was to count from 1 to 10 I would count 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 right they're just whole numbers numbers that you know are just like basic counting numbers the other type of numbers are referred to as floating-point numbers or sometimes people call them decimal numbers these would be numbers like two point five or six point seven three nine four or seven point eight right numbers that have decimals after them you know we can represent both of these types of numbers inside of Java and we're actually gonna need two different types of containers to do that so first let's create an integer now remember an integer is just a whole number I can create an integer by saying int so this is a keyword in Java and now we can give this a name so this could be like an age and I could say age is equal to 35 and you'll notice when we create a number we don't actually need quotation marks around it like we did up here in this string we can just type out the number as is so I could also print out a number onto the screen so if I just put age down there now we'll be able to print out the number onto the screen in addition to an integer I can also create a decimal number and there's a couple of different ways to create decimal numbers there's actually two data types that we can use for this one is called a float and the other one is called a double I'm just going to show you guys a double because I think that's a little bit more commonly used so we can just say double and again we'll give this a name so let's say GPA and let's say someone's GPA is like a 2.7 so now we're able to store this 2.7 value inside of this GPA double so I'm only able to use a decimal point because we're saying that it's double so if I came over here to this 35 and I gave this a decimal point you'll see that we're getting this little error message and it's giving us this error because we're basically not able to use a decimal number inside of an integer so these are the two types of numbers that you're going to be working with the most and just know that integers are whole numbers and doubles are decimal numbers there's another type of data that we can use which is a character and a character is kind of similar to a string so up here we have this string it's just a bunch of different characters but a character data type just stores one single character so why don't we put this down here and to create a character we can just say CH AR and we'll give this a name so why don't we store this as like a grade for a test so someone's grade let's say they got in B on their test and in order to create a character we want to use these single quotation marks right here so unlike when I created a string and I use these double quotes I'm going to use these single quotation marks so in here we'll put the letter that we want to store so again we can only store one single character inside of here so I can store a capital A I can sort of lowercase a really you can store any character you want it's only gonna be one character though that's very important in addition to string character in double there's also one more data type that is really gonna come in handy inside of Java which is called a boolean and a boolean is maybe a little bit less intuitive than like a char an int or a double a boolean is a true or a false value and if you're new to programming you might not understand why we want to represent a true or false value but as you go through this course you'll understand a lot of times in programming we want to store true or false data and a boolean value can have one of two values true or false so I can create a variable and I can either give it a true or a false value so let's create a boolean you just type out boolean just like that and again we want to give this a name so let's say we'll give this a name of is mail so is mail will basically store whether or not someone is a mail and I could set this equal to true and so this is mail valid variable has a value of true I could also make it false and in this case it would be false but those are the only two values that you can store inside of this is a mail variable true or false so again if I wanted to I could print out any of these variables on the screen we could print out is mail and it'll print out false just like that we've kind of looked at a bunch of these different data types and for the most part I would say for a beginner these are the only data types that you're really gonna need there are a few other data types in Java that we can get into and we'll probably cover some of them later in the course but for now just know that these are all the different ways that you can store data and these data types allow you to store different types of data now one more thing I just want to point out that we can also represent these data types without putting them inside of variables so down here in this system dot print line I could just say like 35 and I wouldn't have to store it inside of an age variable I could just say this and it's gonna know that it's a number I could say 35.9 it'll know that it's a double I could say false I could say true I could give this a character or I could just give this a string so I don't need to store these values inside of variables a lot of times you're gonna want to but if you want you can just access them directly inside of something like a print line 



in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about working with strings in Java now a string is one of the most common types of information that you're going to be using inside of your Java programs string is basically just like a collection of text so any text that you want to store inside of your Java program we can store it inside of a string and today I'm gonna show you just basically like how we can work with strings in Java and I also want to show you guys how we can use specific methods on those strings to do things to them so a method is basically just like a little piece of code that we can call and that code will modify our string or give us information about that string so let's just jump right into it I want to create a print statement so I'm gonna say system dot out dot print line and in here we can just kind of play around with strings so I'm gonna create a string using two quotation marks and why don't we just type out a phrase so we can just say like draft Academy now this is considered a string in Java so I can go ahead and run my program and this will get printed out onto the screen over here inside of these strings we can actually use some special characters so one thing you might be wondering is how could I create a new line inside of my string so let's say I wanted to have draft on one line and Academy on the next line I can actually use a special character so we can type this backslash and when you use this backslash basically what it's telling Java is that we want to include a special little character inside of our string if I type backslash n what this is gonna do is it's gonna create a new line inside of our string so when I run this program now you'll see that draft and Academy are on different lines and I could actually get rid of the space here and now they'll be sort of in line with each other so you can use this backslash n another thing we can do in strings is include quotation marks so if you're working with a string let's say I wanted to put quotation marks around Academy well you'll notice that I'm already using these open and closed quotation marks in order to denote that we're using a string if I wanted to put quotes around it I can use that backslash again so I could save backslash and now I can use these quotation marks and I can do the same thing over here backslash quotation marks and now Academy will have quotation marks around it so we'll run the program and you'll see that over here we have quotes around Academy so there's certain characters inside of these strings that mean certain things so for example let's say I wanted to put a backslash inside of my program I can't just put a backslash like this this backslash is actually used as an escape character which means it kind of like tells the string that we want to do something special so I could just use backslash backslash and now I'll be able to have a backslash inside of my string as you can see over here so there's a bunch of different things you can backslash and actually if I just type out the backslash here a little list should pop up for us and you can see here valid escape characters are backslash B backslash T backslash and our double quote single quote and backslash so you can play around with all of those different back slashes and build all you can do different things inside of your strings so let's talk about how we can move strings onto different lines one thing you might be wondering is like let's say I had a really long string of text inside of here and it like went off the screen you can actually move strings onto different lines so they'll display better so I could just click hit enter and my text editor eclipse is actually gonna automatically do this for me but what you can do is you can type out a line and this is gonna be like open and closed quotation marks move on to the next line you use a plus sign and then you can type out more open and close quotation marks so I could technically create as many of these lines as I wanted and it will just allow me to move the text on two different lines but this isn't actually gonna create new lines when I print this out so when I print this text out you'll notice that it's all gonna be on the same line as you can see up here but that just sort of makes it a little bit easier to you know manage the strings that are inside of your code so now what I want to do is create a string variable and I'm gonna show you guys how we can use special string methods so I can just say string phrase is equal to traffic adenine and if I want to print this out I can just go down here and talk about phrase and this will basically just print out traffic adda me but there's actually some cool things that we can do with this variable so inside of Java there are these little things called methods and a method is basically just a little piece of code that we can use on something like a string and it will either modify that string or it will give us information about that string so don't worry too much about you know the specifics of what methods are just know that we can use them to do different things to our strings so there's a couple of different methods that I want to show you guys and the way that we can use a method is just by typing out the variable name and I can just say dot and now I can type out the name of the method that I want to use so one method we can use will convert this string into all uppercase so I can say to uppercase and anytime I call one of these methods I always want to use an open and close parentheses after it so you'll see here we have phrase and then I'm calling a method on this so I'm saying doc the name of the method to uppercase and then an open and closed parenthesis so as long as you have it structured like that you're gonna be able to call this method so now when I run my program you'll see that it prints out draft Academy but it's all in capital letters so that's actually kind of cool I can also use another one which is to lowercase so I bet you guys can guess what this does it's going to convert all the text into lowercase those are two useful string functions and you'll notice that those two functions to uppercase and to lowercase those are actually modifying what the string looks like and certain methods are going to allow you to do that you can also use methods to get in firm about the string so there's another method we can use which is called length so I'm just gonna say length and this will tell me how many characters are inside of this string so now when I run my program you'll see that it gives us 15 because there's 15 characters inside of draffa CAD amis so this is an example of a method that gives us some information about the string we can also find out some more information about this string so I could actually use another method which is called contains and this method is unique because we can actually give it some information so the contains method is going to tell us whether or not our string this phrase string contains a certain set of characters so I can come in here and I can actually give this a value and sometimes with these methods you don't need to give them information but other times you need to give them information for them to perform their function so I'm gonna give this some information and I can just type out like Academy and this is basically gonna tell us whether or not the phrase string contains the word Academy and you'll see here I can run my program and it returns a true because our string does contain the word Academy but if I was to type in like dog here this is gonna end up being false because our string doesn't contain the string dog so that's kind of a cool method and that's actually going to give us back a boolean value which is kind of cool so the length method gave us a number back and this contains method gave us a boolean value back so it gave us a true or false value back in addition to using this contains method there's actually another cool method we can use which is called char app and basically what char app does is it'll allow us to specify a index in the string and it'll tell us what character is at that index so I could give this a number and it'll tell me like what character is at that position in our string so I'm gonna give this a 1 now you'd think that when I give this a 1 it's gonna give us this G character right because seems like the G care during is that the first index of the string it's a it's the first character in the string so phrase dot char at should give us this G and when I run the program you'll see that it doesn't give us a G it actually gives us an I so this char app method is supposed to tell us what character is that the index that we give it but it's actually giving us this eye and there's a reason for this and now this is a point that I want to bring up when we're dealing with strings particularly when we're dealing with the index of strings it's a little bit different in Java so normally you would say like the first character in this string is G the second character is I the third character is are like if I had to give these index positions I'd say like o character one is G but inside of Java and actually inside of a lot of programming languages we start the indexing at zero so you start counting at zero so if I was to say what's the first character in the string Java would say it's this I because I is technically at index position one G over here is at index position zero so if we want it to write out the indexes for this string it would be like zero is G 1 is I 2 is R 3 is a 4 is F 5 is the other F 6 is e so the character at index position 0 is G the character at index position 3 is a so inside of this char app function I need to give this the index that I want to access inside of a particular string so if I wanted to access that G all I'd have to do is say 0 and now because G is it the 0th position in the string Java would say G is the zeroth character inside the string now it'll return this G over here so let's try this one more time let's see if we can grab this F right here well F is going to be an index position 0 1 2 3 4 so if we put 4 inside of here now we should be able to access that F which we do so that's how you can use char at and that's also information about how strings are indexed and that's gonna come in handy in Java you just know that the 0th index inside of a string is always going to be like the first character inside of the string so this char out methods gonna be really useful and I want to show you guys another method that we can use which is called index of and this is kind of like the opposite of the char at function so and also I just want to point out I I think I might have said the word function a couple times in addition to saying the word method inside of Java the word function and the word method actually mean the same thing so if I say function it means the same thing as if I say method so this index of method is basically gonna tell us at what index a specific character is inside of this string so inside of index up I can just give this like for example a character so I could say a and what this will do is it'll tell me at what index that a appears so I'll click the Run button and you'll see it says 3 over here so index of gave us the index of this first a so 0 1 2 3 a is it the third index inside of the string so when I say index of a it's gonna give us that index you can also type in like a just a string so if I said a FF II it's gonna be able to do the same thing so now I'll click play and you'll see it's still giving me this 3 it's basically telling me where this collection of characters starts so a FF II starts at the third index of the string but you'll notice that we're actually only grabbing this first a so there's another a over here and over here so if I wanted to for example grab this other a I can use another function which is called last index of and last index of is gonna tell us the position of the last location of this character so if I just said a now it's gonna give us the index of this a character right here so let's run the program and you'll see it gives us 10 and that's the index of this a character so that's index of and last index of and those are gonna come in handy a lot you're definitely gonna be using those when you're writing Java there's one more method that I want to show you guys and it's called substring and the substring method is a really powerful method because it's going to allow us to grab a specific part of our string so let's say that I just wanted to grab this Academy word right here what I could do is I could count up and I can figure out at what index this Academy string starts and I can give that to this substring method so it's going to be 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so that capital a starts at 8 so when I just give this 8 now when I run the program it's just going to print out Academy so it's gonna print out all the text that is including and after that 8 index so it'll just print out Academy I can also give this a range so let's say I just wanted to print out instead of Academy just a CA right what I can do is I can give this another number and this brings me to another point is a lot of times in Java you can pass in multiple values inside of these methods so these would be referred to as parameters and so we would say I could pass in multiple parameters into this method in order to do that I'm just gonna type a comma and we want to put another number here and this is going to be the index that we want to stop grabbing the string so here we have 8 9 10 so I want to stop grabbing it when we get to that 11th character so I'm gonna put 11 in here and now we should just be able to grab a CA which we can do so you'll notice that this first number here this 8 that gets included in the substring so this capital a is at index position 8 and that's gonna get included inside of the substring as we can see over here but the second number this 11 which is this d that's not gonna get included inside the substring so that's just like a little tip that you guys can use I won't also want to show you guys a different way that we can do this so we can actually pass in a method inside of another method so let's say that in the phrase I only wanted to grab the first word right how can I only grab the first word well what I want to do is just grab the word up until I see the first space so we can actually use the methods that we've learned so far in this video to do something like that so what I'm gonna do is I'm basically gonna say I want to start grabbing the string at 0 right so I want to definitely want to grab the first word so I'm substring I want to put 0 but then we need to put in index where we want to stop grabbing the word right and let's just assume that I don't know the index of this space right I just want to grab the first word I can actually use another method we could use that index of method in order to get the index of this space so I could say over here phrase dot index of and in here we can just put a space so now this is going to tell us the index of the first space inside of this phrase string and it's going to use that as the ending index for the substring so I'm gonna run this program and you'll see now we're just getting the word draft so if I was to change this which is cool like I could type out whatever I wanted in here and it's always just gonna grab this first word so I'm gonna click play and you'll see it grabs that first word up until the first space so we're saying phrase dot substring we're starting the substring at the first character so it's 0 and then the last character where we want to stop is going to be the index of the first space in the string so hopefully that makes sense and this is just an introduction into using these string methods there's actually a few more that I'm sure we'll get into in the rest of this course but for now just know that that's how we can use different methods on the strings 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about working with numbers in Java numbers are extremely common datatype and when you're working your java programs a lot of times you're gonna want to work with numbers so I'm gonna show you all the different things you can do with numbers we're gonna talk about how different types of numbers interact and I'll show you some awesome math methods that we can use to perform more complex math operations on the numbers in our programs so let's get started here's the basics I'm if I just wanted to print out a number on to the screen I could just like type in any number inside of this system dot print line statement and it'll just get printed out onto the screen but let's say that I wanted to do something a little bit more complicated what if I wanted to add two numbers together well if you want to add two numbers all you have to do is just type out the numbers that you want to add and the operator that we want to use so I could say like 3 plus 4 and now instead of just literally printing out 3 plus 4 job is gonna go ahead and execute that operation for us and it's gonna print out the sum of 4 and 3 so you can see here we get 7 so in addition to using a plus sign we could use a minus sign that I'll subtract the numbers and you also see that Java has no problem with negative numbers so if I take 3 minus 4 we're able to get negative 1 and it'll display just like that so we can use subtraction we could also use division and division is just going to be this forward slash and then we can also use multiplication so let's go ahead and divide these numbers let's take 3/4 and you'll see that we get 0 now here's the first distinction that I want to make in Java there's two different types of numbers there's integers and then there's decimal numbers and there's a couple different data types that we can use for decimals but let's just say that they're doubles because double is the most common datatype for decimal numbers because I'm dividing two integers in other words 3 is an integer in 4 is an integer I'm getting back an answer that's also an integer so 0 in an integer now normally 3/4 would give us a decimal answer but since I'm dividing the integer 3 by the integer 4 I'm only going to get an integer answer back if I was to come over here and say three point zero divided by four point zero now I should get a decimal answer back so you'll see now we get zero point seven five which is the actual answer so whenever you're doing math inside of your java files you want to always make sure that you know what data type you're using if you're using integers you want to make sure that you're okay with getting an integer answer if you're using doubles then you want to make sure that you're okay with getting a decimal answer so those are just some basic math operations that we can do there's one more I want to show you it's called the modulus operator so I could say 10 mod 3 and that's just this percent sign right here what this is gonna do is it's gonna take 10 it's gonna divide it by 3 and it's gonna spit out the remainder that we get so 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1 and so we should now get a 1 over here on the screen so in certain circumstances you're gonna want to get the remainder of a couple numbers getting divided and you can use the modulus operator to do that so in addition to just printing out numbers we can also store them in variables and I'm gonna create a couple different variables we'll create an integer and we'll just call it my int and we'll just set it equal to 3 and then we'll also create a double call of my double and we'll just set it equal to 5.5 and I could just come down here and use my integers to do my math so I could say for example 5 plus my int and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna say 5 plus 3 so we'll end up getting 8 and you can see we get 8 over there here's a question though what happens if I add a integer and a double together so let's say if I wanted to add my double and my aunt we're actually gonna get back a double answer so anytime you perform math using a double and an integer you're always going to get to answer as a double so you see here we're gonna get back eight point five instead of just a normal eight so you can use doubles and you can use ants to do your math and I want to show you guys some other math operations that we can use now there's a lot of more complex math operations that we might want to be able to use and Java has this thing called the math class and the math class is basically just a huge collection of methods that we can use to perform more complex math on our numbers and don't really worry too much about what a class is we're gonna get into classes later in the course but a method is basically just a chunk of code that's gonna perform a specific operation so there's a lot of these methods for different math calculations and different math operations that we can use to do them in our programs so the first one I want to show you is gonna be a method that allow us to get the absolute value of a number so all we want to do to access these math methods is just say math and that needs to have a capital m and then I'm gonna access the method that I want to use so I can say math dot abs and abs is a method which will basically give us the absolute value of a number so inside of these parentheses I actually need to give this a number so I'm gonna go ahead and pass in my double and what this will do is it'll give us the absolute value of the number in here so I'm gonna make this a negative five point five so the absolute value of negative five point five is just gonna be normal five point five so that's allowing us to use absolute value we can also use one for power so I could say P o W here and I'm actually going to use the in so say my int so I can pass in the number that I want to take to a specific power and then I can pass in the power that I want to take it to so if I said three basically what we're saying here is we want to take three to the power of three so we want to get three cubed and over here on the screen C we get 27 because 27 is three cubed right three times three is nine nine times three is 27 so you can use this POW method in order to like use Exponential's we can also do the opposite of this so we could say s QR T and s QR T stands for square root so I'm just gonna give this a number why don't we give this like 36 so s QR T of 36 the square root of 36 is going to be six and we'll just get that back over here there's also some other useful functions another one I want to show you guys is called min and min will basically take in two numbers and it'll tell you which one is the smallest one so if I passed in like two and six this min method is going to return the smaller of the two numbers so let's run the program you can see it returns two so in a situation where we had two numbers and we didn't know which one was smaller so for example I could say 2 and over here I could say my int maybe I don't know what number is stored inside of my int so this number this min method could tell us which one is smaller you can also use max so max of 2 in my--in is just gonna return 3 because my in has a value of 3 which is bigger than 2 so that's the max function there's a couple more I want to show you guys another one we can use is round and round is basically gonna take a decimal number and it's gonna round it so I could pass in my double and this will round my double using like normal rounding rules so let's run this you'll see we get negative 5 so it's actually rounded the number down and you know you put any number you want in here so for example I could put like five point nine and Java is gonna go ahead and round it up another useful method is called random and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna spit out a random number between zero point zero--------CUT OFF




in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to get input from a user in Java one of the cool things about working with a programming language is we can write programs that users can interact with and any cool program is gonna allow the user to like input some information or you know they'll be able to control different aspects of the program and I'm just gonna give you guys a basic introduction into how you can allow users to affect the program by entering in information so this is gonna be a really fun tutorial and it's gonna be awesome to be able to make our programs interactive the first thing that I need to do in order to get user input is I need to create something called a scanner and a scanner is basically a special entity in Java which is going to allow users to input information into our programs so the way I create a scanner is just by saying scanner and we can give this a name so I'm gonna say keyboard input and this is gonna be the name of the scanner so we're essentially just creating like a variable here and then I want to set this equal to new scanner and inside of these parentheses right here I just want to type system dot in so let me try to explain this line a little bit what I'm doing is I'm saying scanner so I'm creating a scanner I'm calling it keyboard input and I'm setting it equal to a new scanner and inside of here I'm just putting system dot in now you'll notice here I'm getting these little red lines underneath this scanner and it says scanner cannot be resolved to a type and down here we have this little option it says import scanner java.util i'm just gonna click this and what you'll see is when I go up to the top of my file here we have this new line it says import java.util.scanner basically what's happening is here here is we're trying to use this scanner inside of our program but in order to use that scanner we have to import it into our program so I have to tell Java like hey can you go out and get the scanner for me so I can use it inside of my program but don't be too intimidated about this import statement basically all it's saying is we want to include the scanner inside of our program so that we can use it so just type out this import statement up here and now you'll be able to use this scanner once we have our scanner setup we want to prompt the user for information so I want to print something out on the screen that tells the user what I want them to input in this tutorial we'll just create a very simple little app which will ask the user for their name it'll grab the name and then we'll be able to print out hey name so the first thing I want to do is print out a prompt so I'm gonna say system dot out dot print and I'm just gonna say print here so previously in this course we've been using print Ln what println does is it'll take whatever you put inside of the parentheses it'll print it out and then it'll print a new line but in our case we just want to keep everything on the same line so I'm just gonna say print and then inside of these parentheses I can just say whatever I want to print so we'll say enter your name and actually I want to put a colon here and we'll put a space so now that we have the prompt we can actually get the input from the user so here we can use that scanner and remember I just called the scanner keyboard input I can say keyboard input dot next line and then open and closed parentheses and what this is gonna do is it's basically gonna say ok here we have this keyboard input I'm gonna wait until the user enters in a line of text so the program is going to stop here at this command and it's going to wait until the user enters in a line of text and what we want to do is we want to be able to grab that line of text and store it inside of a variable so we can create a variable over here we'll just say string name is equal to keyboard input dot next line so basically what's happening is whenever the user enters in a line of text we're gonna store whatever they enter inside of this string called name and now we'll be able to access whatever they entered by just accessing this variable so let's come down here we'll make another print statement system print and this time I'll just use print line and all I want to do is print out hey and then we'll print out the name so I'll say hey name and then we can print out like an exclamation point and so now what should happen is the user should be able to enter some text we'll store that text inside of this variable called name and then we'll print out the variable and basically say hi to the user so I'm gonna run this program you'll see over here in our console we have this prompt it says enter your name so I can just come over here and I can type in my name so I could type in Mike and now when I click enter I'll have entered a line of text so that text will now show up and it'll say hey Mike so I click enter and it says hey Mike so we're actually able to enter text into this program I'm gonna run the program again and I'll show you we can do this with another name so I could say like hey Andrea and it'll say hey Andrea so I'm typing in input the program is grabbing that input and using it to print something else out so let's do something else let's say we want the user to be able to enter in their name and also their age and this will give us a chance to use another little function so we're printing out answer your name we're grabbing the name and now I want to do something similar so I'm just gonna copy this and we'll move this onto the next line here so instead of saying enter your name I'm just gonna say enter your age and now we'll be asking the user to enter in their age so what I can do is I can actually specify to Java that we want to accept a number input so over here I'll just say age and instead of saying dot next line I'm gonna say dot next int this is basically gonna tell Java that we want to grab the next piece of input and turn it into an integer so we're expecting them to enter an in 2h and then over here I can just say int age so now we can also print out the age because it will have gotten that so we can say hey name and then we can say you are age years old so we're basically just saying hey name you are whatever years old so we're just saying how old they are so let's run this program and you'll see it has okay enter your name so I'll enter my name and enter your age so I'll enter my age and now it'll say hey Mike you are 23 years old so actually mess up this string there a little bit but you guys get the point right it says hey Mike you are whatever years old we're basically giving this program some input so over here I said keyboard input dot next line and that's because I wanted the line of text that they gave me to be converted into a string down here I said next int because I was expecting them to enter an integer so then I just said age but I could also if I want to just say next line over here but I would have to make this a string so that's the basics of getting input from a user and you can do this you know as many times as you want basically you just put out the prompt you have them enter something in you store what they entered in into a variable and then you can print it out 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how you can build a basic calculator in Java so we'll build a little calculator where the user can enter in two numbers and then the calculator will add those two numbers together and print out the answer onto the screen so it's gonna be pretty cool and we can use this scanner in order to do that so in the last lesson I showed you guys how we can use a scanner in order to get input from a user and basically all I have to do to use this scanner is just say scanner and I give it a name so keyboard input in our case and I set it equal to a new scanner and I pass system dot in into these parentheses then up here I also need to say import java.util.scanner and that basically just tells java that we want to use the scanner so now that we have the scanner set up let's create a little calculator so first thing I'm going to do is I'll say system dot out dot print and in here we're basically gonna prompt them to enter in the first number so I'll say enter in first number and then we'll put a colon and after this we basically want to take the number that they enter in and we want to store it inside of a variable so I'm gonna create a double variable so say double and we'll call this number now I'm gonna set this equal to keyboard input so I'm referring to this scanner and we're gonna say dot next double and what this is doing is it's basically telling Java that we want to take whatever the user inputs and we want to create a double variable from it so we're assuming that the user is going to enter in a number so we'll take whatever number they enter and we'll store it inside of this double variable we can actually do the same thing for the second number so I'll just copy this and we can say instead of enter the first number we'll say enter the second number and we'll just call this num two and again it's just going to be keyboard input dot next double so at this point in our program we've prompted the user to enter in two numbers and we've grabbed both of those numbers and stored them inside of doubles finally we just want to print out the answer so we can say system dot out print line and we're gonna print out the answer that we get so it's basically just gonna be num1 plus num2 so let's go ahead and run our program and we'll see how we did I'm gonna click the Run button over here and it says enter in first number so why don't we enter in ten enter in second number let's enter in 15 and it's gonna print out twenty five point zero so it's basically taking the two numbers adding them together and then again over here you'll see that we have a double and the reason that we made it a double and not an integer is so that I can put any numbers I want in here so I could put in like ten point five for 276 and I could also put in like thirty point nine three thousand and nine point whatever and it's gonna be able to add in those numbers no matter what here's one of the problems with this calculator though this is a very basic calculator obviously we're just starting off with Java but one of the problems we're running into is when I run this program if I don't enter in a number here so if I just said dog you'll notice that we get this error and that's basically because the user didn't enter in what they were supposed to enter in they didn't enter in a number and this is a problem that you're gonna run into with a basic calculator like this and as we go through this course you're gonna learn different ways that we can check to see what the user input so eventually we're gonna learn about something called if statements and we'll be able to figure out you know what the user input if they entered in a number and if they did enter in a number we can use it and if they didn't we hit yell at them for it so that's just something to look forward to as this course goes on but for the most part that's how we can build a basic calculator inside of Java 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how you can build a mad libs game in Java a mad libs is a pretty fun game and over here on my web browser I just have a example of a mad lib basically you would enter or you would like write down like a list of words so like an adjective a noun an adverb plural noun and things like that and then those words would be taken and they be put randomly into a story and would kind of like change the meaning of the story it can be pretty fun so I'm gonna show you guys how to build one of those mad libs in Java now over here I already have some stuff set up I have this scanner set up it's called keyboard input and basically we can use that scanner to get input from the user I also have my Mad Libs story so we just have this poem it says roses are red violets are blue I love you kind of a sappy love poem so I think we should Mad Libs it up inside this poem I'm basically gonna want to have the user insert a couple things so we'll have them choose the color we'll have them choose the noun so this will be plural noun and then we'll also have them choose who you're gonna love so we'll have them choose like a celebrity or something so instead of just being roses are red violets are blue I love you it'll be roses are and the color the user enters the plural noun are blue and then I love celebrity so this should be pretty funny and what we want to do is get some input from the user so we want to be able to get a color a plural noun and a celebrity from the user so the first thing we'll do is create a prompt and I'm gonna say system that I've got print and inside of here we'll say enter a color so the first thing we want them to do is enter a color and then we're actually gonna store the color that they enter inside of a variable that will create so we'll say string color is equal to and we want to say keyboard input dot next line and this is basically just gonna grab the line that they input and store it as the value for that color variable and we want to do this whole thing two more times for the plural noun and for the celebrity so I'll just paste this in two more times we can change this guy down here to celebrity or actually I guess the celebrity is the last one and then we'll say enter a celebrity and this one will be plural noun and so we'll say enter a plural noun so now we have our program setup right I'm getting input from the user so I'm getting the color I'm getting the plural noun and I'm getting the celebrity from the user now all we need to do is we need to take those variables and we need to insert them into our story and we'll print out the final story so we'll say roses are and now instead of just saying color we're just gonna say the actual color variable same thing with plural noun so we'll just enter in the plural noun variable and then we'll do the same with celebrity so we'll just enter in that celebrity variable so now we should be able to get all the Mad Libs answers but we want and they'll show up inside of our story so let's run our program and see how we do so over here it says enter a color so let's enter in magenta enter a plural noun we'll do microwaves and then enter a celebrity let's say like Tom Hanks and now we have our poem so it says roses or magenta microwaves are blue I love Tom Hanks and we could keep running this so I could you know put really whatever I wanted in here we could say like roses are orange and the puddle now it might be like bananas and the celebrity could be Morgan Freeman and so no matter what we put in here it'll automatically insert it into our little Mad Libs so obviously this is a very simple mad lib we're only allowing the user to enter in three different values but you can see how you could create like this big Mad Libs game and you basically model any Mad Libs that you want inside of this simple program so that's how you can do something like a Mad Libs in Java 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to use arrays in Java now an array is a special structure inside of Java where we can store information so we can store data inside of an array and it's pretty similar to a variable so if you're familiar with variables in Java you know that a variable can store a single value so I can create a variable and I can store like a number or a string or a boolean value inside of that variable one of the limitations of just creating a regular variable is that you can only store one value and a lot of situations when we're programming we're gonna want to store large amounts of data so instead of just storing one piece of information we're going to want to store a bunch of pieces of information like a bunch of values and we can basically use an array to do something like that so I'm gonna show you guys how to create an array and it's all gonna be really clear so the way we can create is a written array is pretty similar to the way that we create a variable the first thing I want to do is specify the type of data that I'm gonna put inside of this array so I can just say string and now since I'm creating an array I want to make these open and closed square brackets and this basically tells Java that we want to create an array we don't want to create a variable remember an array can store multiple values a variable can only store one value so we're gonna create our array and then we're just gonna give it a name so I'm just gonna call this friends so maybe this will be like an array that stores a list of all of our friends and we can set this equal to something so I can say string box friends is equal to and now I can make these open and closed curly brackets and inside of here I can just start typing out the values that I want to put inside of this array so we could start typing out the name of some of our friends so I could say like Jim so this is going to be one entry in the array when I want to add another one I just put a comma and now I can put the next one so we could say like Karen and Kevin so right here I'm creating an array and I'm storing three strings inside of it I'm storing Jim this is the first element in the array Karen is the second element in the array and Kevin is the third element in the array so we basically have a variable except we're storing a bunch of different values so inside of this one friends array we can have three different values and really you can put as many values inside of an array as you want that's what they're for they're meant to hold large amounts of information so the question becomes now that we've stored this data how can we access it in other words let's say I want to access one of these individual values inside of my array well I'm gonna come down here into this print line statement and I'll show you how we can access one of these values if I just type out friends like this and I try to print it out to the screen you'll notice over here that we get this like crazy string basically this is just saying that we have an array of strings that doesn't really help us I want to access the individual elements so I can use a special syntax I can make an open and close square brackets after the name of the array so again I'm typing out the name of the array and then open and close square brackets inside of these square brackets I can just say the index of the element that I want to access in the array so if I want to access the first element in the array this string with Jim inside of it I can put a 0 here now the way that arrays index the content is they start counting at 0 so we would say that this jim string is actually at index position 0 so this would be a position 0 this Karen string would be at position 1 and this Kevin string would be at position 2 so if I want to access this string inside of this array I have to put a 0 in here because the array starts indexing at 0 not 1 so if I type friend 0 there this should print out that first element in our array you can see that it does if I type a 1 in here now we'll print out Karen and if I type a 2 in here will print out Kevin so you can access individual attributes inside of this array by referring to their index inside of the Raye and that can be really helpful another thing that we can do is we can actually grab some information about this array so I can actually access an attribute about this array called length so I can say friends dot length and if I just type this this is actually gonna tell me how many entries are inside of this array so you can see over here it says three because there's three elements inside of the array so in a lot of situations you're gonna want to be able to figure out how many elements are inside of your array and you can do something like this another thing we can do with arrays is modify one of these values so let's say that I wanted to modify this first value instead of having it equal to Jim we could change the name all I have to do is come down here and I can just say friends and again I want to access the specific element inside of this array so I can say friends zero since I'm trying to access this element and I can just set it equal to something so I can basically use this as I would a normal variable I can give it another value so I could say Mike inside of here and now if I was to print out friends zero then I should just get Mike instead of Jim so I've actually changed or updated the value inside of this array and that can be really useful so now you know how to create an array you know how to modify elements inside of array and you know how to access individual elements inside the array and over here what I did you know the way that I declared the array over here is just one way that you can do it let's say there's a situation where you don't know what elements you want to put in the array right off the bat so for example over here I'm giving this array all the elements like right up front you know I know exactly what I want to go in there so I just put them in there and we're good to go but in a lot of cases when you're programming you're not gonna know what you want to put in the array right away and so what we can do is we can actually create this array a different way so I can say string friends and I can just set this equal to new string and then I want to type these open and close square brackets inside of these square brackets I need to tell job how many elements I want to put inside of this array so for example when we have that list of friends we have three elements inside of it so I'm just going to put three over here but let's say we wanted to have ten elements we could just say ten and when you're working in Java you have to be very specific with how many items you want to store inside of your array and we can use something like this to do that so we're basically creating this string we're telling it how many elements we want to put in it but we're not telling it what elements we want to put in it just yet and the way that we can do that the way that we can populate this array is by doing something like this so you see down here I have friends 0 is equal to Mike well what this is gonna do is it's gonna insert this element inside of the array so now when I print out that first element it's gonna give me Mike if I try to print out the second element though so if I put a 1 in here you'll notice that we get the value of null and that means that we haven't put a value inside of this array in position 1 yet so why don't we go ahead and do that I can say friends 1 and we'll just set this equal to Karen and actually we'll put one in for the last one too so we'll say friends 2 is equal to Kevin so now this array should be fully populated with all of these values so I can actually access that first element in the array and I'm able to get the value so that's the basics of working with arrays arrays are extremely useful and you know if you plan on going forward with Java programming you're definitely gonna use them so I would recommend just playing around with arrays giving them different values you know playing around with accessing the values modifying the values and really just get comfortable using them 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about creating methods in Java now a method is basically just a block of Java code that we can use to perform a specific task or a specific function and generally you're gonna take a bunch of Java code you're gonna put it inside of a Java method and then we'll be able to call that method and execute all the code that's inside of it now another word for method is function so if you ever you know use a different programming language sometimes methods are referred to functions but for our case you can call these either methods or functions and you know you're basically going to be on the right track so I'm going to show you guys how we can create a method in Java and then we'll use it to for example like say hi to a user so over here in my Java file you'll notice that I have a couple things here up here this says public class app and this is basically just the name of our you know like Java program and then down here we have this thing public static void main and this is actually believe it or not a method in Java and this is a very special method in Java so this is a method which gets called in other words the code inside of this method gets executed when we start our Java program so that's what makes this method special but in addition to this method we can also create other methods inside of this Java file so I'm gonna make a couple new lines and we're gonna come down here and you'll notice here I'm out of the bounds of this public static void main method so I want to create another method I'm gonna put a bunch of code inside of here and then you'll see we'll be able to call that method and access all the code inside of it from up here in our main method so the way that we can create a method is a little bit complex and I'm gonna be using some keywords here you'll see they get highlighted in purple that you might not fully understand and that's okay for right now as we go throughout this course we're gonna figure out what all of this stuff means but for now I'm gonna be using some certain keywords that you guys might not understand so just know that it's okay and you can just type out whatever I'm typing out and it should work so I'm gonna type down here public static void and now what I want to do is I want to type out the name of the method that I want to create so I'm gonna give this method a name let's make a method that just says hi to the user so I'm gonna make a method called say hi so I can type out the name of the method and then I want to type out and open and close parenthesis and then an open and closed curly bracket so now what we have is the basic skeleton for a method and like I said you know public static void this is sort of a little bit beyond what we're gonna learn about right now I just want to talk to you guys about creating methods but just know that if you put this here then everything should be fine now inside of this method I can type out some code and when I call the method that code will get executed so in here I'm just gonna put out put some code will say system dot out dot print line and we're just gonna print out and we'll basically just say hi to the user so we can say hello and why don't we say hi to me so say hello Mike so we're saying hi to Mike now what I can actually do is I can call this method so up here inside of my main method and remember this is the method that gets executed when our Java file runs I can just call this method so I can just go here and I can say say hi and then make an open and close parenthesis and a semicolon and now what's gonna happen is when Java sees this line of code it's gonna come down here to this say hi method and it's gonna execute all of the code inside of this method so why don't we come over here and we'll run this program and you'll see it just says hello Mike so it's executing all of the code inside of that function and I just want to illustrate what's happening here so I'm gonna add in some more print statements just so we can kind of really wrap our heads around how this works I'll add in a print statement up here and a print statement up here and so I'm just gonna say right here top and we'll say over here bottom and I want to show you guys how this ends up printing out to the screen so what's gonna happen job is gonna come it's gonna say okay system dot print line it's gonna print top then it's gonna go to this say hi function it's gonna print out hello Mike and then it's gonna come back out and it's gonna print out bottom and so this will kind of illustrate how the flow of the program works with these functions so I'm gonna click play and you'll see here we're printing out exactly that so top and then it comes over here execute the method and then it prints out bottom so really the flow of this program is we're executing this first line when we call the function we jump over to the function and we execute any code that's in here so if I put like another line of code in here and we could say like hello Tom this would now execute both of those lines of code before it executes bottom so when you call a function you're basically telling your program to jump over to that function execute all the code in there then come back and you move on to the next line and the program so that's kind of the flow of functions and that's really like the basics right I can just take all my code put it inside of its own function but I want to show you guys some more stuff we can do with these functions and one thing we can do is give this function some information so right now inside of this public static void say hi function and actually I just realized I'm saying function instead of method so again you can say function or method those two words are kind of like synonymous I've just been jumping around to different programming languages so I'm kind of more used to saying function but these can be called methods or functions so inside of this say hi method I'm just printing out hello Mike but let's say that I wanted to be able to give this method some information so I wanted to tell this method who I wanted to say hi to we can use something called a parameter and a parameter is basically just a piece of information that you give to the function so I have this say hi function right here I can actually give it some information and the way that we do that is by just coming over here into these parentheses and we want to define a value that method is going to take in okay so I'm gonna define a value and you basically define it just like you would define a variable so in our case we want to take in a string which is going to be the name that we want to print out so I can just say string name and basically what this is doing is it's telling Java that this method should take in one value it needs to be given one piece of information which is a string called name so now when I call this method over here I have to give it a string so I have to pass in a piece of information so I could just pass in for example like a name could pass in like Dave and what we can do is down here inside of our method we can actually access this name variable so I could come down here and say hello name so now depending on the value that we pass in here that's what's gonna get printed out so let's go ahead and run this program and you'll see what happens so over here it says hello Dave so let me make a couple more of these methods so I'm just gonna copy this and we'll just say hi to a bunch of different people so we can say hi to Dave Phyllis and Angela so now three separate times I'm gonna say hi to different people so I'll run this function and it says hello Dave hello Phyllis hello Angela so I was able to give the method specific information and depending on the information that I gave it it printed out a different name so if you wanted you could also pass variables into here so I can just say string my name is equal to Mike cuz that's my name and then I could just pass in my name into here and it's gonna work exactly the same in addition to just passing in one value we can also pass in multiple values so let's say that in addition to saying hi to the user I also want it to print out their name so I wanted to give this method two pieces of information that it can use to say hi to the user if I want that I can come down here in addition to specifying that we need a name I could also specify that we needed an int called age so now this method is taking in two parameters and so when we call the method we need to pass it two parameters so why don't we just do this once we'll pass it my name and then we'll also pass it an age so we could say like 47 so now I'm passing it two pieces of information and then down here we can just modify our print statement so I can say hello name you you are and now we can just say the age so age so now I'm able to use both of these pieces of information to modify this method so when we come over here now it's gonna say hello Mike you are 47 so I could modify you know either of these values I could say instead of 47 we could say like 20 and we can make the name Toby and you'll see that everything works the same so now it's saying hi to Toby who is 20 so that's basically how you can pass information into methods and methods are gonna be extremely useful like there's so many different things that we can use methods for and basically anytime you have a specific code that's performing a specific task you want to put it inside of a method and you know I could put as many lines of code in here as I wanted I mean obviously I'm just creating a simple method but you could make a huge you know long method and it'll perform a specific task but a general rule of thumb is anytime you have a collection of code that's doing something that's you know has a function or that's performing a task you want to put it inside of a method and that way you can just access it by the name of the method and you can give it specific information 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about the return statement in Java methods so a lot of times when you create a method in Java not only are you going to want to call that method and maybe give it some information in the form of parameters but you might also want that method to give you some information back so I might write a method that goes off and does some tasks for me and then tells me like oh yeah the task went well or the task went bad so we can use return statements to allow methods to give us some information after we call them and I'm going to show you guys how we can do that I want to create a method in this tutorial that will basically cube a number so when you cube a number and you take it to the power of 30 so if I was gonna cube 2 I would say ok 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 so 2 cubed is gonna be 8 right it's just some basic math but we'll create a function that will do that so will basically tell the function of what number we want to cube the function will cube the number and then it will return the answer back to us so down here I'm gonna go right below my public method and I'm just gonna go outside of it and I'm gonna say public static and right here if you watched the last tutorial when we created our method we said void right here but now because we want to use a return statement in Java we're actually gonna have to put the data type that we want the method to return so in our case we're just gonna cube a number so why don't we just return an integer so whatever you want your method to return whatever datatype you want it to return you're gonna have to put that here and you guys we'll see how this works in a second I'm just gonna call this method cube because it's gonna cube a number and we're gonna have this method taking some parameter a number so I'm gonna make an int and it's basically just going to be called number 2 cube right so this is gonna be the number that we want to cube now inside of this method I can use something called a return statement so I can say return and whatever I put after this return statement is to get returned back to whoever calls the method so I can say return number two cube x number two cube x number two cube so basically what I'm doing here is I'm just multiplying this number three times so I'm saying number two cube times number 2 cubed times number 2 cube and then we'll put a semicolon over there and so this is just cubing the number and actually we can put some parentheses around this just to make it a little bit more readable and we're basically saying that we want to return the result of cubing the number back to whatever called this function and I want to show you guys how that works so up here we're gonna call this function so we're just gonna say cube and I'll just pass in a two and so you'll notice that when I run this program nothing's gonna show up over here so we just have an empty screen right but if I was to print out this function so I could say system dot out print line if I printed this out we're actually gonna be able to print out that value so when I click play it's gonna print out eight so what's happening is when I use this return statement all the sudden when I call this cube method this thing gets a value back so when I call it inside of this system that out dot print line it's able to print out eight because this is actually representing a value in other words it's getting a value back so we're able to print it out just to illustrate this further I could create a variable so let's make a very an integer and we'll just call it my num and we'll set it equal to cube 3 so why don't we cube three now this variable my num is gonna have the value of cubing 3 because this right here when we call this function it's getting a value back and so we're actually storing the value that gets returned from this function inside of this integer so if I was to print out my num it's just gonna print out three cubed so you'll see over here it prints out 27 and so that's basically how returns work and you know I could write a bunch of code up here so I could write some more lines of code up here and then just return down at the bottom of the method and so I also want to illustrate to you guys sort of the flow and sort of what return does so I'm gonna print some stuff out and over here I'm just gonna print out the word top and we're also gonna print out the word bottom so I want to print bottom out right after we use this return statement but you'll see here that this java is throwing an error so i'm getting an error here on this text and it says unreachable code basically what happens when you use a return statement is that you exit out of the method so I'm not able to put a print statement over here because this code is actually never going to get executed when I use this return statement it breaks me out of the method and so anytime this route you see this return here it's basically just gonna leave the method and it's gonna be done executing this method so any code that you put after that return statement it's just never gonna be executed because it's never gonna be reached once we hit this return we're leaving the function so that's just kind of like a little bit about the flow of methods like when you use that return statement it just exits you out of the method right away so also I don't just have to return an integer here if I wanted to return for example a string all I would have to do would be to change this guy right here so if I write if I wanted to return a string I could just say string and obviously I'm gonna have to return a string value so over here we could just say return value and now we should just be printing out instead of 27 it should just print out returned value we will notice we're getting an error over here I tried to make this an integer but really it's returning a string so we're gonna have to make this a string and now our error will go away so now say return value let's say I wanted to make this a boolean I could do the same thing I can just change this over here to boolean and I'm gonna have to return a boolean value so we could return true and then up here again I'm gonna have to modify this so I'm gonna have to say boolean and now this is all gonna work so now we would return true so that's the basics of using return values in Java these can be really powerful it's basically just a way where your method can give you some information back so we can use parameters to give our in from to give our methods information and we can use returns to give information back to whoever called the method 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using if statements in Java and when if statement is a structure inside of Java which we can use to help our programs to make decisions so I can create an if statement and it'll allow my program to respond to different situations so when one situation occurs our program can do one thing and when another situation occurs our program can do another thing and believe it or not you actually use if statements in your everyday life so as a human being you're constantly encountering these different if statements so I want to show you some examples I have over here this text file and it has some examples of if statements that a lot of people would encounter every day so here's one it says I wake up if I'm hungry I eat breakfast so over here we have this condition right the condition is basically saying if I'm hungry if that condition is true in other words if you're hungry then you'll go ahead and eat breakfast but if this condition up here is false then you're not hungry so you're not gonna eat breakfast so you'll just skip over this guy and move on here's another one it says I look at my phone if it's about to die I charge it so again we have this condition up here it says if it's about to die if that condition is true then we're gonna charge the phone if that conditions false we're just gonna skip over this and we're not gonna charge it right so those are two basic if statements we I have a couple other ones over here these ones are a little bit more complicated says I leave my house if it's cloudy I bring an umbrella otherwise I bring sunglasses so here we have this condition if it's cloudy if that condition is true then we bring an umbrella otherwise if that condition is false then we bring sunglasses so here we have this extra little word here otherwise and basically this just means that if this conditions false up here then we're just gonna bring the sunglasses and then finally we have one down here which is even more complex that says I'm at a restaurant if I want meat I order steak otherwise if I want pasta i order spaghetti and meatballs otherwise i order a salad so here we have two different conditions we're checking the first is if I want meat if that's true then they get a steak otherwise we're gonna check this other condition down here where we're gonna check to see if we want pasta if that's true then we get the pasta otherwise we get a solid so these are four different if statements and I'm gonna show you guys how we can create something like this inside of our java programs so just like you or I would make a decision like this our Java programs can also make decisions using things similar to this called if statements so I'm gonna go back over to my alpha dot Java file and in here we're gonna create an if statement the first thing I want to do is create a variable and we're gonna create a boolean variable and this is gonna be called is male and basically this variable is gonna tell us whether or not someone is a male so in my case I am a male so why don't we set this equal to true so now we have a boolean variable called is male and it has a value of true let's say that in our program if the person was male we wanted to do something and if they weren't male we wanted to do something else well I can create an if statement which will allow us to decide something like that so I can say if and I'm going to make an open and closed parenthesis and an open and closed curly bracket inside of this parenthesis I can put a condition so if you remember in those if statements we looked at before we had certain conditions like if I'm hungry if it's raining if I want meat in here we can put our condition in our case we want to check to see if the person's male so I can just say is male and really all you need inside of these parentheses is a true or a false value and if the value inside the parentheses is true then we're going to execute the code that we put inside of these curly brackets if this is false we're just gonna move on so I'm gonna put some code in here we're just a system that print line and I'm just gonna print out you are male right because we know for a fact that if this variable is true then they are a male so let's go over and we'll run this program and you'll see that it says you are male and that's because this is male variable is true if I was to change this to false however let's say I changed is male to false now we're not going to print out you are male because the person isn't male let's say that we wanted to do something though if the person wasn't male so we wanted to do something else I can use a keyword in Java called else and what this will do is the code inside of the else block will execute whenever the condition up here is false so I'm gonna say else and down here we'll just print something out so we can just say you are not mam right so now since is male is equal to false this is gonna tell us that it's gonna say yeah you're not a male but if I set is male equal to true then we're gonna say you are a male so what we're doing in this program is we're allowing our program to respond to the value of a variable right my program is now smart enough to respond to is male right so if the person's male my program can respond to that if they're not male my program can also respond to that so my program just got smarter and it's also able to make a decision we can actually take this a step further too so what I want to do is create another variable up here so I'm going to add another variable into the mix it's gonna be boolean something called is tall and I'm gonna set this equal to true so now we have two variables and I can actually use both of these variables inside of my if statement so let's say that I want to do something when the person is both tall and a male well I can come over here inside of this if statement and I can say if is male and then I can use enough special operator in java called the and operator so I could say if is male and is tall and what this is gonna do is this is only going to be true when the person is both male and tall so if one of these guys is false in other words if they're either not a male or not tall or neither male nor tall the code inside of here isn't going to execute so in here we'll change this to be you are male you are a tall male and then down here we can put you are either not male not tall or both so we know for a fact if this code is getting executed that they're not male or they're not tall or they're just not either so both of these are set to true so when we run this program it's gonna say you are a tall male but let's say that I change the is male variable to false right so here we would have someone who's not male but is also tall now I can save this program and when I run it it's gonna say you are either not male not tall or both so the program is responding to these two different variables and so here we're able to print something out when the person is male and tall but we can also use another operator in Java which is called me or operator and so instead of saying and we can just say or and so what this is gonna say is if the person is male or the person is tall then we want to do something so unlike when we use that and where both of these have to be true now only one of these has to be true so if I was to put is male equal to false and is tall equal to true now it's gonna execute the code inside of this first block so it'll say you are a tall now so obviously I would have to change the text inside of here to match what we're actually doing but that's what or does it basically allows you to put two things inside of here and as long as one of them is true then the whole thing is going to be true but if both of them are false then the whole thing's gonna be false so I'm gonna put this back to and and I want to show you guys how we can make these even more complex so here we're checking to see if the person is male is tall but what if we wanted to do something when the person was male but when they were not tall so if we were dealing with the situation where we had a male who wasn't tall I can create another condition down here using something called an else if so we're just going to type in else if and then an open and close parenthesis and an open and close curly bracket and I'm just gonna click enter so here I have another thing which is else if so I can actually check another condition so here we can say is male and we want to check to see if they're not tall so I can use this exclamation point and I can say is tall and what this exclamation point does is it basically negates whatever is over here so if is tall is equal to true this exclamation point will give us the opposite and if is tall is equal to false this exclamation point will give us the opposite of that which is true so I'm checking to see if somebody isn't tall right but we need to true values inside of here so if is tall is false and I use this exclamation point on it that'll make it true hopefully that makes sense this exclamation point basically just takes the opposite of whatever is over here so in this case we would have a situation where someone is a male but they're actually short so I'm gonna copy this and we can paste this in and it says you are a short male right because they're a male but they're not tall I can actually include one more situation so there's one more situation we need to cover which is when we have someone who is tall but isn't male so I'm gonna make another else if I'll just say else if and over here I'm gonna put that last condition so this would be when they're not a male and they are tall so this would just be like you are not a male but are taller so now I'm able to cover every possible situation so if the person is both male and tall I can cover that if they're male not tall I can cover that if they're not male and tall I can cover that and if they're not male and not tall I can cover this and so actually down here we would say you are not male and not tall because we know for a fact that they're neither of them so let's see how this works I'm gonna go ahead and run this program and right now we'll just start it off with both of these equal to true so is male is true and is tall is equal to true and our program will tell us you're a tall male if I make is male false then our program will respond to that so it'll say you are not a male but are tall if I make is male true and is tall false it'll respond to that as well it'll say you are a short male if I make both of these false it'll be able to respond to that so it'll say you are not a male and not tall so this is the basics of using if statements we can use boolean values like is male and is tall and we can check to see if different conditions are true now there's also another way that we can put conditions in here which is by comparing the values so I can compare one value to another and if the comparison is true so in other words I could say like if v is greater than three then I would do something otherwise I could do something else and in the next video I'm going to talk all about using comparisons and comparison operators but for now this is the basics of if statements and this is basically how you're gonna use them in your Java programs 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you some more about using if statements now if you watched the last video I basically gave you guys an introduction into using if statements and we had a couple different boolean variables and we were checking to see if they were true or false and in all these different situations we were basically printing something different onto the screen in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys some more about using those if statements and we're actually going to use things called comparisons so we're going to use these different comparison operators in order to create if statements so what I want to do in this tutorial is create a method so I want to make a java method and the whole purpose of that method is gonna be to figure out the maximum number so I'm gonna be able to pass this method three different numbers and it'll just spit out whichever is the biggest so down here in our program I'm gonna make a new line after this public method and I'm actually gonna create another method so we're gonna say public static and I want to give this a return type so this function is going to return an integer value so I can say public static and and we're just going to call this max and what this will do is like I said we'll pass it three numbers and it will return the largest of the three numbers so over here we're gonna give this three parameters and I'm just gonna say int num1 int num2 and int num so we're defining these three parameters so now inside of this method we can actually write all of our code so I'm actually going to use an if statement in order to tell which of these numbers is the biggest so we'll come over here we'll make an if statement so I'm just gonna say if and inside of these parentheses we need to provide a true or a false value right we need to give this a condition and what I want to do is use something called a comparison so in order to get a true or false value I'm actually going to compare two different numbers so I'm gonna say if num1 is greater than or equal num2 and num1 is greater than or equal to num three so this is gonna be my condition and you'll see over here instead of just putting in like a true or a false value I'm putting in a comparison so I'm comparing num1 - num2 i'm basically saying if number one is greater than or equal to number two and number one is greater than or equal to number three this comparison is actually going to end up being true or false so this is going to end up being a true or a false value and over here we're using a comparison operator so I'm checking to see if it's greater than or equal to and that's called an operator so if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and number one is greater than or equal to number three then we know for a fact that num1 is the biggest so I can just return this I'll just say return num1 but that's only if num1 is the biggest so if this isn't true we want to check to see if num2 is the biggest so I can say else if and inside of here we're gonna give this another condition so we can say else if num2 is greater than or equal to num one and num2 is greater than equal to num three so in this case num2 would be the biggest so we can just return num2 and finally if num1 isn't the biggest and num2 isn't the biggest then we can be pretty sure that num three is gonna be the biggest so now we have our entire method written out and we're able to cover every situation right so in the situation that num wants the biggest we have that covered in the situation that num2 is the biggest we got that covered and finally we got num three covered so this is a complete method and let's test it out so I'm gonna come up here into my main method and I'm basically just gonna print out to the screen so I'm gonna print this method out onto the screen so we'll print the integer that gets returned to us out so I can say max and I want to pass this three numbers so we can just pass it three four and five and what this will print out is the biggest of these three numbers so we should get five and you can see we get five over here so if I made num2 the biggest it's gonna be able to handle that and if I made num1 the biggest it's gonna be able to handle that so we're able to handle every single situation and we have this awesome method so really the point of this tutorial was to introduce you guys to these comparisons instead of just putting a true or a false value inside of the if condition we can actually compare different values and that will give us the true or false values so this comparison is either true or its false right it's gonna resolve down into a true or false value same goes with this one over here and we can use these comparison operators in order to check things so in addition to just having greater than or equal to we can have equal to and so this double equals is going to check to see if these numbers are the same we can have not equals and this is going to check to see if they're not equal so the comparison num 1 not equal num2 that's going to be true when the two numbers aren't equal to each other we can also just have greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to and all of those are gonna allow us to compare different values so that's the basics of using comparators with if statements I hope you guys learn something and hopefully you can create little max function for yourself 



in this tutorial I want to show you guys how to create a calculator in Java if you've been following along with this course you'll know that in the beginning of the course we created a calculator that was extremely basic so essentially you would just enter in two numbers and then the program would take those numbers add them together and display the result on the screen in this tutorial we're gonna create a more advanced calculator so this calculator will be able to add numbers subtract them multiply them and divide them and you'll be able to tell the program which one you want to do so over here in our Java file I've just set up this scanner and it's just scanner keyboard input so the name is keyboard input and it's just say evil it's a new scanner system dot in and I also imported the Java scanner up here in the first line of my file and you basically are just gonna want to have a scanner and we can use this scanner in order to get input from the user and for our calculator to work we're actually going to need three pieces of information from the user we're going to need the first number we're gonna need the operator and we're gonna need the second number so the first number will just be that first number and then we need like a plus sign a minus sign division sign a multiplication sign and then we need that second number so I'm gonna go ahead and write some code to get that information from the user so we can say system dot out print and I'm just gonna print out a prompt so I'm gonna say enter a number and what I want to do now is I want to store the number that they entered inside of a variable so I can create a double variable I'm just going to call it num1 and we're gonna set that equal to whatever the user entered so that's just gonna be keyboard input dot next double so it's basically just gonna grab the whatever they input convert it into a double and store it in num1 the next thing we want to do is get the operator so I actually want to grab like a plus sign a minus sign or division sign multiplication sign so we're going to have the user enter in one of the signs so I can say enter and operator and I'm actually gonna instead of creating a double we're just gonna store that as a string and we're just gonna call it Opie and we're gonna set Opie equal to keyboard input and we're just gonna say dot next and basically what dot next will do is it'll just grab whatever the user enters but it won't grab anything after a space so if the user entered like a plus sign a space and then a minus sign it's only gonna grab that plus sign so next is probably our best bet here if we want to grab just like whatever they entered and then finally we want to grab that second number so I'm just gonna copy that code from up there and we can just say enter another number and we'll just call this one num2 so with this code that we've written over here we're now able to get the first number the operator and we can get the second number so the question becomes after we get all this information how do we actually perform the mathematical operation that the user wanted the key really lies in this Opie variable so the key lies in the operator like if they entered a plus so we want to add the numbers they entered a minus sign we want to subtract the numbers so how can we figure out what they entered well in order to do that we can use an if statement so an if statement is going to allow us to check a bunch of different conditions and if one of those conditions is true then we can add them or we can subtract them or whatever so I'm going to show you guys how we can create this if statement I'm just gonna say if and inside of here I want to check to see if that operator is a plus sign so we can basically say if Opie dot equals and there's this special equals method that we can use on strings and it'll basically allow us to compare two strings so I want to see if Opie if the operator that they passed in is equal to a plus sign and if it is equal to a plus sign then I'm just gonna print out that on to this I'm just gonna print out the result of adding the numbers on the screen so I'll just say num1 plus num2 right so if the operator is equal to the plus sign we know we need to add them so I'm just gonna add them and we move on we also want to add in and else so I'm gonna say else if else if opt equals a minus sign so if it's not equal to a plus sign will come down here and we'll check to see if it's equal to a minus sign and if it is we'll just subtract the two numbers and I can just do the same for multiplication and division so we'll make two more else ifs and here we'll use division and then we'll divide the numbers and here we'll use multiplication and we will multiply the numbers and then finally if none of those conditions is true we'll just print out a statement basically saying like hey you didn't enter in a correct operator so we can just say invalid operator so let me walk you guys through this one more time we're saying if the operator that they gave to us is equal to a plus sign then we're basically just going to print out the addition if it's equal to a minus sign will print out the subtraction and then the same for division and multiplication otherwise if it's not equal to plus minus divide or multiply then we know they put an invalid operator in there so we're just gonna yell out them so let's go ahead and see if our program works I'm just gonna run the program and over here you'll see it says enter a number so I'm gonna enter 3 enter an operator let's enter plus sign and I'm gonna enter a 7 so when I click enter that whole if statement should run and we should hopefully get 10 which we do so there we go we got the correct answer and I'm gonna run this again and we'll try something else so let's try division I'm gonna try to divide 10 and we'll use division and we'll try to divide it by 6 and so you can see we got the correct answer which is 1.6 so let's try one more and we'll do multiplication let's multiply 7,000 times 5 and we get 35,000 so we now have a fully functional calculator you can you know basically do the four basic types of matech inside of here and it actually works 


in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about using switch statements in Java now a switch statement is basically just a special type of if statement so a switch statement can allow us to make decisions in our Java project but a switch statement is used in a very special situation it's used when you're trying to compare one value to a bunch of other values so in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about what switch statements are and in what situations you want to use them I want to create a method and inside of this method I basically want it to be able to take a number as an input so I want this method to be able to be passed a number and I want it to convert that number into a day of the week so over here in this text file I have basically these different mappings so I have the number 0 would get mapped to Sunday the number 1 gets mapped to Monday number 2 gets me up to Tuesday etc so I want this method to be able to take in a number and depending on what that number is I want it to be able to spit out you know either Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday basically this method will convert a number into a day of the week so let's go ahead and do that and I'm gonna come down here below this public method I'm gonna create my new method so we're just gonna call it public static and I want this method to return a string right so it's gonna take a number as input and it's gonna return a string so I'm just gonna say string and we're just gonna call this get day name and inside of here we'll just pass in a parameter so it's gonna take one parameter which is gonna be an integer and we'll call this day num so this is gonna be like the number of the day now in here basically we want to convert the day num into a day string so I'm actually going to create a string here and we'll just call this day name and this will just be like the name of the day and initially we'll just set it equal to the empty string and then the last thing we're gonna want to do in this function is just turn the day name so I'm just gonna set up the basic skeleton now inside of this method we need to convert the number into the day name right I need to be able to do that conversion now one way that we could do that would be using an if statement so if I wanted to I could just come over here and I'll just say if and I could check to see if de num is equal to 0 and if de num is equal to zero then we can just set Dane name equal to Monday awesome and then I can come over here I can say else if de num is equal to 1 ok now we'll just come and say de name is equal to Tuesday here's the problem though this is kind of a drag right having to create else ifs for each one of these conditions is actually like really really annoying and in our case we have to do this seven different times so I'm gonna have to create seven of these different if structures in order to figure out what day it is and this is a situation where I'm literally comparing the same variable to a different number right so in every single one of these situations I'm comparing de num equal to a different number and this is a situation where we can actually use a switch statement so a switch statement is essentially an if statement but it allows us to compare a single value to a bunch of different values really really easily and remember that's the situation that we're in we have one value daenam and we're trying to compare it to a bunch of different values namely 0 through 6 so we can use a switch statement in order to make that way easier so in order to create a switch statement I'm just going to come down here and get rid of this if statement and we're actually just gonna say switch and we're gonna make an open and close parenthesis and we're gonna make an open and closed curly bracket so inside of this parenthesis we want to put in the value that we want to compare so we're gonna put de num inside of here because we want to compare de num2 like a bunch of different values right so that's the variable that we want to put in there and now inside of the switch statement we can actually start checking different conditions so I can say case and then after I put case here I just want to put what I want to compare this to so I could say case zero and then I can use a colon and I'll make a new line and down here I can actually put what I want to happen so I can say day name is equal to Sunday and actually this might be a little bit easier to read if I put this up on this same line so basically what I'm saying is in the case that day num is equal to zero I want to set day name equal to Sunday and then what I need to do is include a what's called a break statement so I'm just gonna say break and a semicolon and what this is gonna do is it's gonna tell the switch statement that we're done so since we were able to match up the number with the day num now we're just gonna break out of the switch statement because we don't need it anymore so once again this is saying that in the case that day num is equal to zero we want to set day name equal to Sunday so what I can do now is I can just copy this guy and we can basically just paste it down here a bunch of times so I can paste it paste it paste the pace that paste the paste paste it so I'm pasting it seven times and obviously we can format this a little bit better it's kind of messy but what I can do now is I can go through and assign all of these cases different values so I could come down here and say case one I want to set day name equal to Monday case two I want to set day name equal to Tuesday case three is gonna be Wednesday etc so you get the point I'm basically checking each one of these cases individually so I'm gonna go off and do the rest of these and then we'll come back and take a look at how it looks okay so I went ahead and created a case for all the possibilities so case 0 all the way through case 6 and it's mapping a day name to a day of the week in each case so now we should have a fully functional switch statement so if the user enters in a number between 0 six we'll be able to handle it but there's also the situation where the user enters in a number that's not zero through six so if they enter in any other number we're actually gonna want to throw an error so what I'm gonna do down here is I can just say default and this is gonna be like the default statement so if none of the cases up here are true then we're gonna run the code that's inside of here so I can just say de name is equal to invalid day number so I'm just basically throwing like an error message and then again we can just put a break statement so this default is used when none of the cases up here are true so you can see I just passed it invalid a number all right so now we have this get de name method basically set up so let's see if it works I'm gonna head up here to my main function or my main method and I can just basically try this out so I'm gonna print out the result so it just prints out to the screen and I'm just gonna call this method so I'll say get de name and we'll pass in a zero so what we should get is Monday getting printed out and I'll run this code or a Sunday yeah so over here sunday prints out because sunday is the first day of the week I could say like a four and now that's gonna print out Thursday I could say a six this should print out Saturday so our methods working right I'm able to convert a number into a string and if I was I'm gonna enter in like 60 so an invalid number that default statement will run and it'll tell us that it's an invalid number so you want to use a switch statement in a situation where you're comparing the same value to a bunch of different values so this is a perfect case right we're comparing this day name to just a bunch of different values like 0 1 or 2 and that's the situation where switch statements can come in handy and you can see like this switch statement is it's really clean it's really obvious what's happening and just makes it easy for us to use a bunch of conditions 


in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about using while loops in Java a while loop is basically a structure inside of our Java code which allows us to execute a certain block of code a bunch of times so I can create a while loop and I can specify some code inside of that while loop and then the code inside the while loop will just get continually executed through until a concert until a certain condition is false so I'm gonna show you guys like the most basic while loop in the world we'll talk about what they do and how they work so over here inside of my main method I'm just gonna create a variable I'm just gonna call this int I and I'm gonna set this equal to zero actually why don't I set this equal to one and this in I is basically gonna be used as an indexing variable so I'm gonna use it to determine how many times I have gone through my while loop so now let's create a while loop basically the way you do that is just by typing out while and open and close parentheses and then an open and closed curly bracket inside of these parentheses now I can put a condition so this is how while loops work basically inside of these parentheses I put a condition and I'm gonna keep running through the code inside the body of the while loop as long as this condition up here is true so let's say I put a condition up here I is less than 10 or less than let's say less than or equal to 10 now I will keep executing the code inside of this while loop as long as our variable I is less than or equal to 10 so what I can do is I can put some code in here and why don't we just print out I to the screen so I'm just gonna print out I so I'm printing out this variable I and then after this I'm gonna increment I by 1 so I'm gonna say I is equal to I plus 1 so every time we go through this while loop I'm gonna be adding 1 and actually there's a simple shorthand we can use in Java instead of typing out I is equal to I plus 1 I could just type out I plus plus and this will do the same thing so I plus possible just add one - I sort of increment I so basically what's happening is we're gonna execute the code inside of this loop as long as I is less than equal to ten so let's see what happens I am going to save this and we'll run our program and you can see over here our program is done running and it basically printed out numbers 1 through 10 so printed out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 all the way up to 10 so what happened was we went into this while loop and our program said ok is I less than or equal to 10 and initially I was set equal to 1 so initially I is less than equal to 10 then we printed out I write so that's up here we printed out this one then we added 1 2 I then since we were done executing all of the code inside of this while loop we went back up and we check the condition again so our Java said ok is I less than or equal to 10 now I is now equal to 2 so 2 is less than or equal to 10 so we came down here and we printed out I in other words we printed out 2 and we got that over here then we incremented I so I is now equal to 3 and since we finished executing all the code in the loop we come back up here and we check the condition again so after every iteration through this loop we're checking that condition and we're saying I is less than or equal to 10 in this case I was equal to 3 so it's less than or equal to we come down here we print out 3 we're gonna keep doing that until I is greater than 10 as you can see down here we're never printing out a number that's greater than 10 because if the number was greater than 10 we never would have been allowed to print it out because we wouldn't have passed this condition so that's the basics of using a wild we can specify a condition and as long as that condition is true will continually execute the code inside of now I want to point something out about these while loops and let's say that we set I up here equal to 11 so I have I is equal to 11 now you'll notice that the code inside of this while loop is never gonna execute so I'm gonna go ahead and save this and we'll just run the program and you'll see nothing gets printed out so it's a completely blank console and that's because before our program executes this while loop it first checks to see if the condition is true or false so the first thing it does before it executes any code before it does anything else is it checks to see if that condition is true and if that condition is true then it goes through and iterates through the loop but if this conditions not true then we don't even touch the while loop and that's what's happening in this scenario I is equal to 11 therefore I doesn't pass the test I is not less than or equal to 10 so we just move on and that's the basics of a while loop there's also another type of loop in Java and it's very similar to a while loop but it's called a do-while loop so all we have to do to make a do while loop is just take this wild block and I can put it down here and now I can put do up here and we have a do-while loop the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop is that a while loop will always check this condition first so before the while loop executes the code inside of it it checks that condition but a do-while loop will always do whatever inside of here and then it'll check the condition so the do-while loop will execute this code first and then check the condition so I'm going to show you guys now we should actually be able to print out 11 and you can see here we have 11 and that's because the do-while loop executed this code and then it checks the condition so that's the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop and while loops can be really useful there's a lot of situations that we're gonna use them in there's also another type of loop called in for loop and a for loop is really awesome and in the next couple videos I'm gonna show you how we can use while loops and sir situations and I'll also talk to you guys about using for loops 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to create a little guessing game basically we will define a secret word and then the user can go ahead and try to guess that secret word until they get it right and this is a scenario where we can actually use something like a while loop to help us program it so down here in my Java file I just have this scanner that I set up it's called keyboard input and I just set it equal to a new scanner and up here I'm importing the scanner into our Java file so we can use it now down here I want to start writing the code for our little guessing game and the first thing that we want to do is define a secret word so like I said we're gonna have a secret word and then the users gonna try to guess what that secret word is so I'm gonna make a variable I'm gonna make a string and we're just gonna call it secret word and I'm just gonna set this equal to like draft so draf is gonna be our secret word the next thing we need is a variable which is gonna store the user's guesses so every time the user guesses we'll store their guests inside of this variable so I can just make another string and we'll just call it guess and I'll set this equal to an empty string because they haven't guessed anything yet so we'll just leave it blank now here's what I want to do I want the user to be able to guess what the word is and then if they get it wrong I want them to be able to guess again so basically the user is gonna be able to keep guessing the word until they get it right and in order to do something like that we need to use a loop and in this situation we can use a while loop so I'm just gonna talk about a while loop it's gonna be wild open and closed parentheses open and closed curly brackets now we wanted to find a loop condition this is basically gonna be a condition which is gonna tell us how long we want a loop for so what I want to check is I want to check to see if the guess in other words I want to check to see if what the user guessed is equal to the secret word so in here I can say guess dot equals secret word and I want to keep looping as long as the guest is not equal to the secret word so I can use this exclamation point and basically what this exclamation point does is it negates whatever is over here so I want to loop through this loop as long as the user hasn't guessed correctly but when the user guesses correctly I want to break out of the loop and that's what this is gonna do up here it's basically saying gasps dot equals secret word and if that's equal to false then we want to set it equal to true using this knot symbol so hopefully that makes sense what we're doing up there it's basically saying while the guess is not equal to the secret word then we want to keep looping and so down here we can basically display a prompt to the user to enter a guess so I can say system dot out dot print actually we'll just do print and in here we can just say enter a guess and then below this we want to store the value that they guess inside of this guess variable so I'm just gonna say guess is equal to keyboard input dot next line and this will basically just grab whatever text they put into the line and it'll store it inside of this gasps variable so now we're actually able to store what the user guesses and so this is gonna work really well right so we're gonna ask the user to enter a guess they'll enter the gasps we'll store it in this guest variable and then up here we're basically going to check to see if the guest is equal to the secret word or not if the guest is equal to the secret word then we'll break out of the loop if the guest isn't equal to the secret word then we're gonna keep looping so if we have gotten past this while loop that means the user got the word correct so we can just print out a success message you win so they that means they won the game all right so this is basically everything that we're gonna need for this game to work so we headed over to our console and we'll try to play so I'm just gonna click the Run button and now over here we get our prompt enter a guess so I'm just gonna enter like some random words so let's put my name that's not the secret word dog cat none of these are the secret word so you see I can basically keep guessing I can keep entering in guesses until I get the secret word correct and now we'll actually put in the secret word which is draft and we should get that success message which says you win so there we go we got our success message and now we have our functional game so we have a game that totally works and we can try to guess what the word is but here's the thing a lot of times in these games you'll want to limit the amount of guesses that the person has so down here we have our very simple game but let's say we want to make it a little bit more complex so we want to say that the user can only guess the word a certain number of times and if they can't get the word in let's say like three or four guesses then they'll lose the game and we'll basically like say hey you lose but we can actually add that functionality in here to our program so in order to do that I'm gonna create a few new variables in the first variable I'm gonna create is gonna be an integer and is this basically gonna be called guest count and this integer is just gonna keep track of how many times the user has tried to guess the secret word so every time we the user guesses the secret word we're gonna increment this variable so let's go down here and every time the user does a guess we're gonna increment this so down here at the bottom I can just say guess count plus plus and this is just gonna increase the guest count every time we go through this loop another variable I want to create is gonna be called guess limit and it's gonna be an integer as well and this is basically gonna be like how many guesses the user is able to have so if we put like three here then the user would only be able to try to guess the word three times and if they can't get it in three guesses then they're gonna lose the game then I want to create one more variable and this is gonna be a boolean variable and basically this variable is gonna tell us whether or not the person has lost the game so whether or not they've guessed too many times so this is gonna be called out of guesses and we're just gonna set this equal to false so if out of guesses is equal to true then the user will have run out of guesses all right so let's add some of this stuff into our while loop we already incremented this counter over here so we already have that set up but we need to put some logic in here to figure out if the user has guessed three times or not so I'm gonna use an if statement and I'm just gonna put it inside this while loop and we're just gonna say if and basically I want to check to see if the user has used up all their guesses so I can check if guest count is less than gas limit so in other words if they haven't guessed as many times as the guessed limit then we'll give them another guess so inside this if statement I'm just gonna put these lines of code otherwise and actually we're gonna increment the guest count as well otherwise I'm going to use this else statement otherwise we want to tell the user that they're out of guesses so we can just set that boolean equal to true so I'm gonna say out of guesses is equal to true so now we have a way of determining whether or not the user has run out of guesses so let me walk you guys through this one more time because this is kind of a lot of code every time we go through this loop in other words every time we can offer the user a guess we want to check to see if the guest count is less than the guessed limit if the guest count is less than the guessed limit that means they have some guesses remaining so we'll give them the prompt and will allow them to guess again and then we'll increment the guest count if the guest count is equal to the guessed limit or greater than the guessed limit then we're gonna set this out of guesses boolean value equal to true and what we can actually do now is modify the loop condition up here we're gonna keep looping as long as the guess isn't equal to the secret word but we also want to stop looping if they're out of guesses so what I can say is and not out of guesses so basically this is saying we want to keep looping as long as the guess isn't equal to the secret word and as long as they're not out of guesses so if they are out of guesses then we'll break out of this loop so that's basically how this is gonna work and we want to do one more thing so I'm actually going to come down here after this while loop and you'll see here we're just printing you win but if they break out of the while loop there's actually two possibilities the first possibility is that they won the game right they guessed correctly but the other possibility is that they ran out of guesses right because up here in this condition one of the ways that we can break out of this loop is if they're out of guesses right so what I can do is basically check to see what situation we're dealing with I can say if out of guesses so in other words if out of guesses is true then we can give them a message saying like you lose right because they ran out of guesses so you lose no more guesses otherwise since we know they're not out of guesses it must mean that they won so we can paste this code into here so I know this is a lot of code let's see if it works and then I'll just walk you guys through it one more time so I'm just gonna click play over here and we will run our program so let's go ahead and try to lose the game so I'm just gonna enter in a bunch of guesses one two and this is my third guess so I entered in three guesses I didn't get the secret word correct so now it's gonna say you lose no more guesses right that kind of sucks but let's see if we can win the game so I'll say here's one fake guess and then we'll actually guess the word so we'll say trap and it's gonna say that you won so now we have our game even more functional right we can allow the player to only guess a certain number of times and if I wanted to modify how many times the player could guess I could change this guess limit variable alright so that was a lot of code I want to walk you guys through this one more time I created a few variables up here once called secret word once called guess and then I created three more variables the guest count and this keeps track of how many times the user has tried to guess the word we have the guessed limit this is the maximum amount of times that the user can guess until they run out of guesses and then out of guesses is a boolean variable which is gonna tell us whether or not the user is out of guesses here in this rile loop we're gonna keep looping through the loop as long as the guess is not equal to the secret word and as long as we're not out of guesses inside of this loop we're checking to see if the guest count is less than the guessed limit then we're gonna print out our prompt and we're gonna let them enter a guess and we'll increment guessed count otherwise if the guest count is equal to the guessed limit then they're out of guesses right they've guessed as many times as they can so we're gonna set this equal to true and that's gonna break us out of the loop when we get broken out of the loop there's one of two situations the first situation is that they run out of guesses right so we can check to see if that's the situation and if it is we're printing out you lose the other situation is when they want right so they entered enough words and it's just gonna say you win so there is our basic guessing game and that's kind of shows you like one scenario where we would want to use a while loop in Java 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using for loops in Java now a for loop is a special type of loop in Java that we can use to loop through different blocks of code but what's cool about a for loop is it allows us to use something called an indexing variable and an indexing variable is basically just a variable that keeps track of how many times we've gone through the loop so down here in my Java code I actually have a while loop here and I wanted to show you guys a while loop and then we can transition into a for loop so this while loop is basically gonna keep looping as long as this variable I is less than or equal to ten so I have this various variable I over here it's an integer we set it equal to one and as long as that variable I is less than or equal to ten we're going to keep looping through and every time we go through this loop we're gonna print out I and then we're gonna increment I so I want to show you guys what's gonna happen so I'm gonna run this program and you'll see over here when we run the program we get a series of numbers printed out on the screen so it's just printing out one through ten and what you'll notice is the number that's getting printed out corresponds with the iteration number in the loop so the first time I went through this loop I printed out one the second time I went through this loop I printed out too the third time I went through I printed out three etc all the way down to this ten so the tenth time I went through the loop I printed out ten now this is what we would call an indexing variable right so I over here is acting as an indexing variable in other words on every iteration through this while loop I will tell us what iteration were currently on that's what it's doing and this is a very common situation when we're building loops in Java a lot of times we're gonna want to know what loop were on when we're looping through a block of code so I'm gonna want to know like oh I'm on the second loop or the third iteration of the fourth iteration and this indexing variable I will tell us that this is actually such a common situation in Java that the people who made Java created a special loop just for this situation so you'll notice over here what I want to use this indexing variable I have to kind of go out of my way to do a lot of things so up here I have to like create this variable and then down here inside the while loop I have to like increment it every time this is kind of like a pain and this is such a common situation that developers eventually just got tired of having to do this so they created the for loop and I'm going to show you how we can use a for loop in order to make this looping structure where we're using the indexing variable a lot easier to deal with so down below this while loop will actually create our for loop so I'm just gonna say for and then an open and close parenthesis and open and closed curly brackets so this is like the outline the basic structure for our for loop now inside of these parentheses I'm actually going to store a few things so up here in the while loop all we did was put a condition right we just put this route condition eyes less than or equal to ten inside this for loop parentheses we're actually going to give it three pieces of information the first piece of information we want to give this is we want to define an indexing variable so when we use the while loop we defined our indexing variable up here we said int I is equal to 1 inside of a for loop I can take this same line of code and put it down here in this parentheses so that's the first thing that we want to do the second thing that we want to put inside of here is a condition so you'll notice up here in our while loop we have our condition and so we can put this same condition inside of our for loop so you'll see here that I have my int I is equal to 1 then I have a semicolon and now I'm giving my condition which is I is less than 10 we can also add one more thing which is going to be a line of code that's gonna run after every iteration of the loop up here in this while loop you'll notice that after every iteration we're incrementing I so we're adding 1 on to I so I can just take this and I can put this down here in our for loop and so now we actually have the same exact structure as we did up here but you can see we're using a for loop instead so we're defining our indexing variable just like we did up here in the while loop we're defining our condition just like we did up here in the while loop and finally we're incrementing I and actually you can get rid of this semicolon so you only really want two semicolons one after we make the variable and another after the condition so this is now a valid for loop and this is actually going to allow us to do exactly what we did up here in the while loop so I'm just gonna copy this system that I opted out print line I'll paste it down here into our for loop and now I can get rid of the while loop and we'll just execute this for loop so I'm gonna click the play button and we'll run our program and you'll see that we get the same exact output as we did with that while loop so this for loop is doing exactly what that while loop is doing it's just a lot easier for us to write and for us to manage so one more time I just want to walk you through these things up here up here this in I is equal to 1 we're actually creating an indexing variable so this is a variable that's going to tell us what iteration of the loop were currently on then we're specifying a looping condition so we're basically saying we're gonna keep going through this loop and while I is less than or equal to 10 finally this is a line of code that's going to get executed after we run through this loop which we're just gonna increment I and so we get that same exact structure that we got from the while loop and you can see for loops make it a lot easier you know this is such a common situation where we want an indexing variable that the for loop you know really just streamlines the entire process so I want to give you guys a quick example of how we could use this for loop to print out the contents of an array so let's say that I had an array of names and I wanted to print out each individual name inside of that array so over here let's create an array so I'm just gonna make an array of strings I'm just gonna say string open a closed square brackets and we'll just call this friends and this will just be like a list of friends so I'm just gonna give this some values will just say like Jim Angela and Oscar so we have three names inside of this friends array and we can actually use this for loop in order to loop through this friends array in other words we can use the for loop to loop through all of the entries in this array and print them out onto the screen so I just want to remind you guys really quick how we can access an entry in the array if I said friends 0 this is actually gonna give me this first element in the array if I said friends 1 this will give me the second element and if I said friends too this will give me the third element so this is technically at index position 0 this is at index position 1 and this is at index position 2 so if I wanted to loop through all the friends inside of this friends array and maybe we could like say hi to each one of them I can just modify my for loop a little bit so I want to change this I and instead of setting it equal to 1 I want to set it equal to 0 and I want to set it equal to 0 because array indexes start at 0 so eventually I'm gonna use this I variable in order to access each of the elements inside of the array so I want to start it off at 0 because the index of the array starts off at 0 then instead of saying I is less than or equal to 10 all I want to do is say I is less than friends dot length so I'm basically gonna say I is less than friends length and this is gonna give us the length of the array and we can actually just leave this guy in here I plus plus now instead of just printing out I I want to print out friends square brackets I so in other words I'm printing out the friend at a specific index inside of this variable so because we started in I off at 0 the first time we go through this for loop we're gonna be printing out and zero right the second time we go through the for loop we're gonna be printing out friends one and the third time we go through the for loop we're gonna be putting out friends too so that's why we did this so let's go ahead and run this code and we're gonna see what happens so I'm gonna click the play button and you'll see that out here we have printed the contents of the array so this for loop is really useful because we can just print out any array right I could even add more entries into here so let's add another one Dwight and now when I run this again it's still going to be able to print out every entry inside of the array so that's one of the basics of using a for loop and a really common use for for loops is printing out arrays you're gonna see this example all over the place like this is a really useful thing we can do with these for loops and it's perfect because we have this indexing variable and it can always tell us how many times we've gone through the loop 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about creating a power function in Java a power function will basically allow us to take a number and raise it to the power of another number so it's actually already a method in Java that lets us do this it's the math dot p o w method and in here we can pass two numbers so i can pass a base number and then i can pass in the power number and this is basically just gonna give us like 3 raised to the second power so we'll end up getting nine and this is a pretty cool little method and i want to show you guys how we can build a method just like this inside of our java programs so what's unique about this method is it'll allow us to use something like a for loop in order to loop through and multiply these numbers so i'm gonna come down here and i'm just gonna make another method i'm just gonna say public static void actually we want to return an integer so i'm gonna say public static int and i'm just gonna call this p o w and inside of this powa 'then we are going to pass two parameters so we're gonna accept two parameters two integers so they're gonna be called base num and they're gonna be called pound num so will basically take the base num and raise it to the pound nom so if based on is two and pound umm is three we'll do two cubed right kind of makes sense alright so inside of here the first thing we want to do is create a variable that's gonna store the result of raising base num to power num so I'm just gonna say int we'll call this a result and initially I'm just gonna set this equal to one and what I can do now is I can basically go through a loop and I can continually multiply result by base num so let's see how we can do this I'm gonna create a for loop so I'm gonna say for int I is equal to zero I is less than pound uhm so in other words I want to keep going through this loop as long as I is less than the our number and then I'm just gonna say I plus plus and so now we can go inside of this for loop and every single time we go through this loop right well actually let's think about this for a second just off of this condition up here this whole thing that we're saying we're gonna go through this loop pound um times so if pound um is 2 we're gonna go through this loop 2 times if pound um is 5 we're gonna go through this loop five times right and that's because I set I equal to zero and we're gonna loop as long as I is less than pound um and every iteration of the loop we're adding 1 to I so essentially what this is saying is we are going to go through this loop POW num times so every time I go through the loop I just want to multiply result by base num so I can just say result is equal to result times base num so in the first iteration through this loop the first time we go through it result is set to 1 and so now result is going to be equal to result times base num so results actually going to be equal to based on it the first time we go through the loop right the second time we go through the loop result now has the same value as base num so when we multiply these two together we're essentially getting base num squared the third time through the loop result has the value of base num squared so when we multiply result times base num we're basically getting base numb cube and on and on and on so this is going to allow us to essentially take any number to another power and there's one more thing we have to do which is just return result so now we're just gonna return whatever the result was and I think we should probably try to test this out so instead of printing out math dot power why don't we just print out the method we just made which is just POW so we're no longer accessing that math class so let's see if this works so hopefully we should get a nine back and you can see we get our nine back just like that so let's try another one let's try four cubed so 4 raised to the 3rd power and we should get 64 back and we do okay so this seems to be working so we walk you guys through it one more time real quick we're taking two integers into this method right we're taking the base numb taking the power down awesome we create a variable called result and we set it equal to 1 then we create a loop and we're gonna iterate through the code inside of this loop how num times so if pound um is equal to 5 we're looping through this guy five times if pound Amba is 10 we're looping through this 10 times right every time through the loop we set result equal to result times base num so basically what that does is it continually raises that number to the next power you'll notice that I never modified base num I never modify it I'm only ever modifying this result variable and the result variable is what we're gonna end up returning because after we've gone through this loop pound num of times that's gonna be equal to the correct answer so that is our power function if this doesn't fully make sense your homework is to play around with it play around these different numbers and try to figure out exactly why it's doing what it's doing and then create another method of your own that uses a for loop 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about two separate topics in Java the first thing we're going to talk about are nested loops and a nested loop is a special structure in Java which is basically just a loop inside of a loop so we have two loops and we have this first like high-level loop and then inside of that loop we actually have another loop but I'm gonna show you guys how you can create a nested loop and we'll talk about why they're useful and what situations we can use them in then I also want to talk to you guys about two-dimensional arrays and a two-dimensional array is essentially just an array where every single element inside the array is itself an array and so it's a way that we can define like a sort of a matrix or a grid as a data structure so the first thing I want to show you guys is nested loops though so let's come down here and I'm basically gonna create a nested loop so I want to say for and I'm just gonna make it normal for loop summers a and i is equal to 0 we'll say i is less than 3 actually i want to start i off at 1 just so we can kind of illustrate this a little bit better and i'll say i plus plus now inside of this for loop i'm actually gonna create another for loop so i'm gonna say 4 and this time instead of making a variable called i we have to make a variable called j because we already used i up here so i can't make another variable called i because it'll override this one up here so I'm just gonna say in J is equal to 0 we'll say J is less than like 4 and we'll say J plus plus so now I have this original loop and inside of this loop we have a nested loop so basically what's gonna happen is every time we iterate through this I loop we're gonna completely iterate through the J loop so we'll complete a full looping through of the J loop for every one iteration through the i-league and that's going to make sense in a second so down here I'm just gonna print out the values for I and J on every iteration of this loop so I'm just gonna say system dot out dot print line and we're just gonna print out I&J so I'll just say I is equal to and we'll put I in there and then we can say J is equal to and put J in here and so now I should be printing out values for I and J as we go through this nested loop so I'm gonna hit the play button and I'm gonna run the program and now we'll be able to see what got printed out so over here on the screen and actually I wanna make J start at 1 instead of 0 sorry all right so let's run it again and over here on the screen you can see that we have these corresponding values so you can see we have values for I and values for J so let's look at some of these values it says I is equal to 1 J is equal to 1 I is equal to 1 J is equal to 2 I is equal to 1 J is equal to 3 so you'll notice that the value for I is staying the same right and so on all three of these print outs we're only on the first iteration of the I loop right we're only on like the first time that it's gone through but you'll notice that J is entirely looping through so J goes from 1 to 2 to 3 so for every one iteration of that I loop we completely loop through the entire J loop now you can see we come down here it says I is equal to 2 and just in that iteration we're looping through the entirety of the J loop so that's basically what's happening with these nested for-loops is for every one iteration of this top loop we completely iterate through the bottom loop and nested loops can be really cool and there's actually a few situations where we're gonna want to use them I'm gonna show you guys one right now but first I actually want to talk to you about another thing we can use in Java which is called a two-dimensional array and the two-dimensional array is an array where every element of the array is an array so it's like array within an array and I'm gonna show you guys how we can create one of those so I'm just gonna come up here and the way that we create a two-dimensional array is very to the way that we create a normal array so I'm just gonna say int because we're gonna create an array of integers and then I'm gonna make to open and close square brackets like that and now I want to give this a name so I'm just gonna call this number grid so we're gonna be creating a number grid and there's actually a couple different ways that we can go about making this so one way would be to say equals new int and then make to open and close square brackets like this and inside of these square brackets I'm gonna have to give this some information so I'm gonna have to put some numbers in here and inside this first first box we're defining how many rows we want to have in the array so in other words like how many items do we want to have we could say like 3 and then this box over here is defining how many columns we want to have or in other words like how many elements we want each array inside of the array to have so we could say like 4 but I think this is a little confusing and just because we're just learning two-dimensional arrays I'm gonna create one using this open and close curly brace syntax so inside of these open and closed curly brackets we can put the elements of our array right and if I was creating a normal array I could just do something like this so I could put like some names like put like Jim put like Karen right I'm putting all these different entries inside of this array but with a two-dimensional array every single entry in the array has to be another array so I'm gonna make an entry just like this and this is gonna be a valid entry in our array and so inside here I'm just gonna put some numbers so I'll just say 1 2 3 and then we can make another element which is gonna be another array we can say 4 5 6 and we'll do 1 4 7 8 9 and finally we'll make another entry in here just for 0 so I'll just say 0 and you'll notice that this has fewer elements than these other 3 and that's actually ok and that's one of the benefits of defining the variable ways that we can control all of the individual elements so you'll see like this is the first element in the array but it's an array right this is the second element in the array and it's an array this is the third and then the fourth so I want to show you guys how we can actually access these values so I'm just gonna print out and we'll see we can print out some of these different values I'm gonna say system dot out dot print line and suppose we wanted to access this one right here up at the top left the way I can access that value is by referring to exactly where it is inside of our little matrix here so I can just say number grid and I want to give this to open and close boxes and inside of this first box I want to put the item in the array that I want to access so like I said this was the first item this is the second item this is the third item so I'm gonna put a zero because I want to access this first item in the array remember a razor indexed starting with zero over here I want to put the item inside of this original array that I want to access so this is going to be the zeroth element inside of number grid zero sum to can put zero and now we should be printing out a one on to the screen so you can see over here we get our one suppose I wanted to access this six well I can do something similar so six is in the second list item so we can come down here and we'll put a one and it's in the zero one two index position so we'll just say two and now we should be able to access that six which we do over here so that's basically how we can access any of these elements inside of the two-dimensional array so taking what we learned about two-dimensional arrays and taking what we learned about nested for-loops let's combine our knowledge and we'll write a nested for loop that's capable of printing out all of the elements in the array so it looks just like this so I'm gonna show you guys how to do that down here in our nested for loop I just want to modify a few things the first thing I want to modify is up here in this original loop so instead of having AI equal to zero equal to one I'm gonna have I equal to zero because the array indexes start at zero and instead of saying I is less than three really what I want to do is I want to say I is less than number grid length so this top loop is going to be responsible for looping through all of the rows inside of our array so I'll say that one more time this I loop this top loop is responsible for looping through all of our list items so it's gonna loop through here through here through here and then through here it's gonna loop over each one of those items and then down here in the J loop again I want to set J equal to zero but I want to say J is less than the number of elements inside of each individual array so we're basically just gonna say number grid I dot length so basically what we're saying here is this J loop is actually gonna loop through each individual element of each individual array so the J loop is gonna loop through this this in this whereas the I loop is just looping over this array this array in this array and the J loop loops through each individual element inside of each one of those arrays so hopefully that is a little bit clearer and then down here I'm just gonna print out the element inside of the array so I'm just gonna say number grid I and J so let's just take a look at this and see how see if it works or not and then I'll sort of walk you guys through what we did one more time so I'm gonna run this and actually I want to do one more thing so after we run this J loop I'm just gonna say system dot out dot print line so I'm gonna print a new line and this will just make it a little bit easier for us to see what's happening so and actually one more thing instead of printing a line up here I'm just gonna do a normal print so now when we run this it's gonna look a little better okay so here we are and we're actually printing out all of the elements inside of this two dimension arrey so I'm gonna walk you guys through one more time what we did down here in this nested loop so hopefully you can kind of wrap your mind around it so over here I created this four loop right and this four loop this top four loop is responsible for looping over all of the elements inside the number grid and the elements inside the number grid are all arrays so it's basically just looping through this through this through this and through this it's only going through four times right down here inside of this J loop I'm looping through all of the elements inside each element of the array so the J loop is responsible for looping through like this this and this and then it loops through this this and this and that loops through this this and this and loops through this so the J loop is moving through all the elements inside of each of these individual arrays and the I loop is just looping through the arrays themselves hopefully that makes sense and down here we're printing out I and J so this refers to the row number right refers to like the vertical row number inside that list and this refers to the column number so like each element inside of that list and by formatting it this way we're able to print out each one of those elements and you'll notice here I just used a print line down here in order to like format it a little bit better and I use the print up here again just to sort of format it a little bit better so that's the basics of using nested loops with two-dimensional arrays if this isn't super clear don't get intimidated and this is a sort of a tough concept to kind of wrap your head around all you have to do is just take the example that I gave you in this lesson play around with it tweak it modify it try to break it apart and then really see how it works and eventually you'll just sort of be able to see how this works and you'll really understand what's going on with these nested loops 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about comments in Java now a comment is essentially just a little line of code that we can stick inside of our Java files that's meant to be read by other humans so any comments that we write inside of our files are actually just gonna get ignored by Java the comments are meant for either yourself later on or for other developers who are looking at your Java file you can leave like little notes or you can also use comments to get rid of certain pieces of code temporarily so in this video I'm going to talk to you guys just about how to use comments and the different ways that we can use them inside of Java so down here I'm just sort of in my main method if I want to create a comment the easiest way to do that would be to type two forward slashes and when I type two forward slashes what that tells Java is that any text to the right of the forward slashes is gonna be considered a comment so basically when Java sees these two forward slashes it's just like okay I can basically ignore anything that comes after that because we know for a fact it's not gonna be code so I could type over here like a comment and you'll see that the text actually looks a little bit different than like some text down here and basically since this is a comment it's not going to show up on our Java document so when I run this file you'll see that all it says is comments are fun and it's not giving me an error about this comment because the comment is meant to be read by humans so if I just typed a bunch of stuff down here you'll see that immediately Java starts yelling at me but I can tell you anything after this comment and Java is like okay that's cool like you're just writing in a little note so one useful thing we can do with comments would be like to describe a line of code that we wrote or you could describe like a function or a method and you could say like what it's doing so for example I could say like this line print out a message and you know it's pretty obvious what this line is doing but if I wanted I could put a call above this line and it would basically describe what it's doing now in certain circumstances you're not just gonna want to have one line of comments so for example like if I move on to a new line this is no longer considered a comment and in a situation like that we can use another type of comment which is called a multi-line comment and when we create a multi-line comment we actually need to create a starting comment tag and an ending comment tag and then anything that we put inside of those comment tags is going to be considered a comment so I can actually go like this and I can just say forward slash and a star and then in order to end off this comment I need to say star and another forward slash so now anything inside of these two stars and forward slashes is going to be considered a comment and this is just yelling at me because I'm those aren't actual words but I could put like a word words words and you can see we can create a comment that spans across multiple lines but if I was to write something outside of these star brackets here then it's gonna consider it an error so comments like a stack can be really useful to write little notes or just like little reminders for yourself and if I wanted even I could write a comment after a line of code so why don't create a variable I'll just make a string called dog and we'll just set it equal to German Sheperd a lot of times what people will do is after they create a variable or after they do something like this they'll put a comment after it so I could say like my favorite dog or something basically I'm giving a little comment after this string dog another way comments can be really useful is to temporarily comment out specific lines of code sometimes when you're writing a program you're gonna want to like try to remove a line of code and one option would be to just like you know cut the piece of code run your program and then once you're done running it without it you can paste it back in or you can actually just comment it out so over here when I run this program says comments are fun well let's say that I wanted to run the program you know just one time without this line in there I can put a comment in front of it and now this whole line is gonna be commented out so when I run this program it's no longer gonna print that out but I don't have to like delete this entire line like it's still there and if I want to bring it back all I have to do is just delete the comment and now we'll be able to use it in our program again so comments can be really useful for like commenting out specific lines of code and it's a really common thing that you'll see when you're programming now I just want to say one thing about comments generally comments should be used sparingly so a good practice when you're programming is only use a comment when you absolutely have to a lot of times you know you're better off just trying to write code that's like really clean and really readable than to try and like just put comments everywhere a lot of times developers will get upset or annoyed if there's like a bunch of comments just like littering the entire file but comments can be really useful if they're used correctly so play around with using comments and you can start using them in your java programs right away 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about catching exceptions in Java more specifically we're going to talk about using something called the try catch blocks and basically what this allows us to do is it allows us to be able to monitor for specific errors that might occur in our program and if those errors occur then we can actually just handle them so if a pro if an error happens that would normally cause our program to stop executing we can handle that error and keep executing the program so I'm going to show you guys a simple example of how to do this and you can kind of apply this to a variety of situations so down here I have a scanner setup basically all I'm doing is I'm using this scanner to get a number from the user so I'm basically saying hey print out a number basically getting the next double that they input so I'm saying keyboard input next double this will accept a number as an input and I'm storing that number inside of this num double variable then I'm just printing it out so it's a super simple program I'm just gonna run it and over here it says enter a number so I can enter in a double with like three point nine oh eight and it just prints it out onto the screen awesome so we have a nice little program here but here's the problem if I was to run this program again and instead of putting a number in here I was to put like a letter so god forbid I put something other than a number when I click enter we're gonna get this exception so you can see down here the program actually stopped running so this caused the programs who completely terminate we didn't print out the number we didn't store it inside the variable the program just ended right our program blew up it's done and it says over here exception in thread main Java util dot input mismatch exception basically what this means is Java threw an exception which means something happened that Java didn't like that Java couldn't handle and the program had to terminate and in our case it was an input mismatch exception which basically means they entered in a string when they should have entered in a double so they entered in a double everyone's good everyone toppy but because they entered in a string uh uh Java can't handle that and it can't handle it because Java was supposed to store this inside of a double but it can't store a string inside of a double so the program broke and this is a problem this is a real problem in our programs if you're writing a program and you know somebody enters in a string when they're supposed to enter in a double you don't want your program to blow up right you don't want it to just completely stop working what you want to do is be able to recognize like hey this person entered in the wrong type of input let's tell them that and then we can go off and do something else and I'm going to show you guys how we can do something like that so how we could catch one of these exceptions we're gonna have to use something called the tried catch blocks and basically the way we set this up is I just say try I make an open and closed curly bracket and then down here I just want to say catch and catch is going to take a parameter so we're gonna give it some open and closed parentheses inside of these parentheses I just want to say exception and I'm just gonna call this e so basically an exception is getting passed into this open and closed parentheses if that doesn't make total sense what we're doing here just stick with me and it'll make sense in a second so down here I'm saying it's system that outs out print line and I'm getting the number what I can do is I can actually put this stuff or actually I just want to put these two lines down here inside of this try block and I'm always gonna ask them to get the number so we'll put that up here inside of this try block inside of these open and closed curly brackets I'm actually asking for the user's input and then I'm printing it out and what this is gonna do is it's basically gonna allow us to do this and if our program blows up when we're doing this in other words if an exception gets called when we're doing this then we'll execute the code down here in this catch block so I'm actually gonna copy this and instead of printing out the number we're just gonna print out invalid input okay so now that we have these try-catch blocks set up I'm gonna show you what we can do with them so if I was to come back over to my program and recreate the situation that happened before so I'm just gonna enter in a letter instead of entering in a double now instead of our program terminating and just completely blowing up and we're done now it just says invalid input so it's able to handle what just happened right it's able to handle this situation so that's the beauty of try-catch blocks is they let you look for errors and catch them and then when your program throws an exception we can just print something else out so we can give the user a message like hey you put in the wrong stuff how dare you we can also get more specific with these and I actually want to talk to you guys about this exception e overhear exception is what's called a class in Java and for the most part it's just like a special type of data type so we have like strings we have integers we have boolean's and exceptions very similar to that it's just it's storing some information inside of it and the exception is basically going to tell us what went wrong so if I was to come down here inside of this print line statement I could just print out E now E is the name of the exception that got passed in if I print out E it's gonna tell me what went wrong so if I typed in a over here again instead of printing out invalid input it's gonna tell me what exception was thrown so it's gonna say Java dot util dot input mismatch exception got thrown so this is actually a pretty interesting message right it's telling me what went wrong it's telling me what type of exception was thrown it was an input mismatch exception so let me show you guys another example of using something like this so down here I actually have some code that I commented out and I basically just created a an array so I created an array and I gave it three elements so I just gave it three numbers so it's just 1 2 & 3 and then what I did was I tried to print out the fifth element inside of this array now this array only has three elements right and they're an index positions 0 1 & 2 if I try to print out the 5th element in this array or the element at index position five my program is gonna blow up and I'll show you guys what's gonna happen so before I even get to enter in the the input actually let me put this down here I'm gonna roll my program and it's immediately gonna blow up and we're gonna get another exception you can see over here it says exception and thread main Java dot Lang dot array index out of bounds exception so before we were getting an input mismatch exception now we're getting this array index out of bounds exception this is a different type of exception that we can use in our program and Java basically told us like hey there's no array position at this index so Java couldn't handle that and the program ended up terminating it ended up throwing an exception so there's different types of exceptions for different situations that you're gonna get into in Java and actually what we can do is we can catch different types of exceptions so for example if I was to take this line of code right here that's printing out nums five right it's printing out that fifth index and this is the piece of code that breaks if I was to put this down here inside of this try block so I'm putting it down here this is also going to get caught by this exception so we're also just gonna print out e so now when I run my program instead of breaking it's just gonna say Java dot Lang dot index out of bounds exception five so the program didn't explode it didn't terminate we didn't throw an exception it just printed out what the exception was so if I come down here and I just use this exception datatype if I just say exception it'll catch any exception that's put inside of these try blocks but if I want instead of just putting this exception I can also add in specific types of exceptions right so for example down here we have two pieces of code that are gonna break this program right we have this system that opt out print line that's trying to print out an invalid array index we also have this line of code right here if the user enters in something that's not a double that's also gonna cause an exception but remember these are causing two different types of exceptions the first one is causing an array index out of bounds exception this one is causing a input mismatch exception they're two different things that are going wrong there's two completely different reasons why a Java program blew up right when I just use this general exception word down here this will catch any exception under the Sun it'll catch any possible you know situation where Java threw an exception this is going to catch it but what happens if I have two pieces of code that are throwing different exceptions and depending on the exception that gets thrown I want to do different things well I can actually specify what type of exception I want to catch so for example this is just catching like any old exception under the Sun but what if I wanted to specifically catch this array index out of bounds exception well what I can do is I can actually include a catch block that will catch this specific error so I can copy this this big long name over here and instead of printing out exception over here I'm just gonna put array index out of bounds exception and this is going to specifically catch this situation right here where the number explodes so now if I run my program the same thing is going to happen right so it's just gonna do exactly what it did before it'll be able to catch that array index out of bounds exception but if I got rid of this line so I'm just gonna comment this out so this is no longer gonna be inside of my program and I mess up the keyboard input so I'm gonna come over here and we'll mess up this keyboard input so I'll put another letter this isn't this isn't catching this exception anymore because this catch block only catches array index out of bounds exception z' that's all it can do right it can't catch the input mismatch exception all I can do is catch the index array out of bounds exception so you can actually include multiple catch blocks in here so for example I could say like another catch block and now we can include that other errors so for example our error over here was input mismatch exception so I'm gonna copy this guy and I'll throw this into this second catch block and again we'll just call it Eve so now this is gonna be able to catch this input mismatch exception and you'll see I'm getting an error here so sometimes for some of these exception types you're gonna have to import them that basically means you have to tell Java that you want to use them and that's only for some of them and if I'm on eclipse I can just come down here and click import and you'll see up here at the top of the file it imported Java util you input mismatch exception so now I can put some code over here so I can just system to print line and we'll say invalid and what this will do is it'll be able to catch that invalid input so now when I run this program I can enter in a letter so I can enter in the wrong thing here and it just says invalid input so if you want to catch specific types of exceptions then you can specify those specific types of exceptions inside of these catch blocks or you can do what we did before which was just use instead of one of these you can just say like exception and this will catch any possible exception that you can have so a lot of times what people will do is they'll catch you know maybe like two or three specific types of exceptions and then over here they'll just use that general exception and this will just catch anything else so you know you can have all these so first it'll check if it's an array index out of bounds then it'll check if it's a mismatch input and then if it's neither of those it'll just throw a general exception error so basically the use of exceptions is just so your program doesn't blow up right if you're writing a you know a Java program that's gonna be running for you know months and months at a time you don't want it to blow up no matter what so you always want to make sure that it's able to handle whatever gets thrown at it and you can use these try catch blocks to do that so in addition to exceptions there's also another type of problem that can go wrong in our which is called an error and the main difference between an exception and an error is that an error is like really serious so if you have an exception in your program for example like when the user inputs a letter instead of a number it's not serious right nothing is like actually going wrong in the program it's just you know something happened that Java couldn't necessarily handle but in addition to an exception there's also something called an error and an error is generally something that you don't want to catch because an error means that something really went wrong like something is like seriously wrong with the program and there's no you know possible way that we can recover now that doesn't mean that you can't catch an error in your programs but Java would say that any reasonable application shouldn't be trying to catch an error so the errors are just abnormal conditions you know things that you really don't want to happen in your program no matter what but I'm gonna show you guys basically how to handle them anyway I just wanted to talk to them to talk about them so you're aware of them so instead of saying exception down here I could say error and this would basically allow me to catch any errors that get thrown now you can also call something called throwable so I could say throwable and basically throwable is going to catch either an error or an exception so if you want to catch any errors and any exceptions that occur inside your program if you say throwable that'll basically just catch anything so remember when we just said exception there that caught any exception that could be thrown if we would say error here this will catch any error that gets thrown and there's also some specific errors just like we had specific exceptions but if you say throwable this will catch like any error or any exception so basically like anything that goes wrong with the program this will catch it but again Java recommends like I'm the Java Docs it recommends that you don't any reasonable application doesn't try to catch errors but you should definitely try to catch exceptions so that's the basics of exceptions and we talked a little bit about errors we talked a little bit about throwable there's a lot more to kind of discover with these things obviously you can learn about all the different you know specific exceptions but this kind of gives you an idea of how to implement them in your programs 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about classes and objects in Java I'm really pumped to talk to you guys about this because when we're talking about classes and objects we're really getting into like the meat and potatoes of what Java can do and what makes it awesome so in Java we have all different types of data and there's a bunch of different ways that we can represent that data we can use things like strings we could use numbers like integers and doubles or we could use things like boolean's to represent true or false values but here's the thing in the real world there's a lot of things that can't be represented just too using like strings or numbers so imagine that I was for example like creating a piece of software that managed students at a school right if I wanted to just define a student's major so like a particular students major I could just create a variable I could say student major and I could set it equal to like whatever computer science or something right so if I wanted to just represent you know the students major it would be really easy I could do it using a string but how would I represent like an actual student you know we have the string datatype that we can use and we can give it you know a value of like computer science but there's no student data type like how could I represent a student inside of my java program and the way that we can do that is we can actually use something called a class and what a class allows you to do is it allows you to model a real world attribute inside of your program so essentially what we're doing is we're creating our own custom data type but it's a data type that represents like a real world entities so I could create a data type for like my phone and I could do that by creating a phone class I could create a data type for my credit card and I could do a by creating like a credit card class I could create a data type for a student and I could do it by creating a student class and when we create a class in Java we're modeling a real world entity were basically giving ourselves something that we can use to represent that inside of our programs so classes are really awesome and if that explanation doesn't fully make sense to you right now don't worry it's gonna make sense as we go through this video but for now just know that a class is basically a way that we can define our own custom data type because there's a lot of stuff that can't be represented in just like a string or a number so we can use classes to basically model a real-world entity so in this tutorial I want to create a student class so we're gonna create a class that represents a student inside of our program so I'm gonna come down here into my default package and if you're using Eclipse your setup should look similar to this but if you're not using Eclipse you just want to put this class in the same directory as you know whatever file you've been using with your main method so I'm just gonna right click on default package and I'm just gonna click new class and this will allow us to create a new class so down here we just need to give this a name so I'm just gonna call this student this would be our student class and generally in Java when you create a class you want it to start with a capital letter just like that so I'm gonna come down here and click this finish button and click that and eclipse is gonna go off and create a new student class for us and basically all this is is just a new Java file and inside here just says public class student so this is essentially how we can create a class in Java so let's talk about what this is and what it's doing remember we can use classes to model real world objects inside of our program and the way that we can do that is we can create this class like overall container and inside of here we want to give this some attributes so basically I can give this a series of variables so I can use things like strings or integers or boolean x' to define information about a student and basically we call those attributes so they're gonna be like the attributes of a student so over here I'm gonna start creating some attributes and let's think about what are the attributes that would define like a student in a college for example well we might want to say like first name and last name so we can create two strings one for first name and we'll create another one for last name and let's think what else can we define about a student well another thing would be GPA so we can say Jeep will make this a double and we could say GPA so I'll be like you know 2.5 3.5 whatever 4.0 if you're really smart we can also define their major so I can say string major and let's think what else we could define their age so I could say well I guess I could either define their birthday or their age just to keep it simple why don't we just define their age as an integer and what else what else can we define about a student let's define a boolean value we could say like on probation so this would basically be like true if they were on probation or false if they weren't so this is a boolean all right so what I've done is I created this student class and I've basically defined some attributes about a student so essentially what I'm doing is I'm saying that any student inside of our program can have a first name a last name a GPA a major an age and a on probation very low so essentially what we're doing is we're defining a student datatype and we're saying that a student inside of our program will have all of these attributes associated to it so what I can do now is I can use this basic student class and I can create individual students so you remember like if I wanted to create a variable in my program I have to actually like physically create the variable and give it a value right so if I wanted to create a number I'd have to be like int and you know whatever the number like the name and that I'd have to like give it a value well that's the same thing with these classes you know over here inside of this class declaration I'm basically just defining like what a student is giving a basic template of like here's what a student is inside of our program but this isn't a specific student right if I wanted to start using this I'd have to actually like create a student and give it all of these different values so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that I'm gonna come over here into my program so I'm just going back over to this app Java file over here in this app file I can actually create a student so we can actually create one of these students that we defined over any other file so the way that I can do that is I can basically create it like I would any other variable so the first thing I want to do is specify the data type of the variable that I want to create in our case we're creating a student variable so I can say student and then I can just give it a name so we'll call this student like my student and now what we want to do is we want to say equals new student and then open and close parentheses so this is basically how we can create a new student and what we'll have here is an empty student so this student has no attributes associated to it so what we want to do is we want to start giving this student some attributes so I can basically do that by saying my student dot and now I can access one of the attributes that we defined about the student so I could say my student dot first-name and you remember in that my student class we defined a first-name and I could say equals so I can just say like we'll say Jim and we can do the same thing for last name so I can just copy this guy and instead of saying first name we'll say last name and we'll just give it a last name helper so now we're basically defining the first name and the last name for our student and we can do the same thing for all those other attributes so we could say my student major and we'll give them a major so business and what else did we have so we also had GPA and on probation and age so let's say that jim halpert's GPA he's probably kind of a slacker so it's just gonna be equal to two point three and then we can say my student age 24 and finally we'll say my student dot on probation and this can just be equal to false so what we've basically done is we created this student and what this is called is it's called a student object so what we defined over here in this student.java file we defined a student class and this is basically just like a specification for what a student is in our program so it's basically just defining like hey this is like what a student is it has a first name a last name a GPA a major has all these different things but when we want to create an actual student so like when I want to create a student and like give it different values I can create what's called an object and an object is an instance of a class in other words an object is just like that class that actually has values inside of it so it's like an actual student instead of just like the specification for a student so now we actually have this jim halpert object who is a student in our school so I can come down here and I can actually like print out certain attributes about this object so I could say like my student dot first-name and now this will actually print out the first name of our student onto the screen so let's go ahead and run this program I'm just going to click run and you'll see over here it's printing out the students first name which is Jim I can then print out their last name so now we should get Halpert I could print out any of the attributes about them so I could print out like the GPA and we'll print this out so basically what I'm doing is I'm creating like a student data type I'm creating my own data type and then I can create an instance of that data type or an instance of that class which is called an object and that's just like a particular student inside of my probe so if I wanted I could create another student so I could just copy this entire thing and we could just create an entirely different student down here so we could just call it like my student 2 or whatever and now we'll give this student a bunch of different attributes so we can make it like Pam Beesly and she majors in art and maybe she has like a 2.5 GPA and she's 23 and put her on probation so now we have an entirely different student inside of our program so if I wanted I could come down here and I could access information about that student so we could say like first name and here we're accessing that different student so here we're getting Pam and so the point is that I can define a student and I can like specify like what goes into a student we have like the first name last name the GPA and then I can create instances of that student inside of my program and I can use them so the class is this specification over here it's just like specifying what a student is and an object is an actual like instance of that an object is an actual student who has actual values associated to it so that's classes and objects this is kind of a lot to take in and I know if you don't fully understand what's going on like right now that's totally fine classes and objects are a you know sort of a more advanced topic in programming what you want to do is play around with creating your own classes and objects so I created this student class over here and I created student objects which are just like individual students here's my challenge to you guys take an object in your everyday life you could take like a phone or you could take a credit card or you could take a book and define a class about it so for example if I was defining a credit card class I could give it like the credit card number the expiration date the issuer of the card like Visa or MasterCard you could give it a security number or I could create a class for like a book we could say like here's the title the book and the author and the number of pages so you can create classes to model real world entities and then you can represent them inside of your code doing stuff like this so going forward we're gonna learn a lot more about classes this is just scratching the surface we're gonna learn how to make these way more powerful and make it easier to create them and stuff like that 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys some more about objects and classes so in the last tutorial I showed you guys how to create this student object and this student class over here so just a really drive home this point about objects and classes I want to create another class in this tutorial and hopefully that can kind of just like solidify in your minds what these things are so I'm gonna get rid of all this code and what I want to do in this tutorial is model a book inside of our program so I'm basically going to create like a book data type inside of our program and then we'll be able to like create different books and we'll be able to define different attributes about those books so in order to do that I just want to come over here and I'm going to create a new class so I'm just gonna say new and I'm gonna go over here to class and we're gonna create a book class so I'm just gonna call it book and then down here we'll just click finish so eclipse in my case is automatically gonna go ahead and create this book Java file and this public class book inside of this class we want to basically define what a book is gonna be inside of our program so we want to give this book different attributes and we can use those attributes to essentially just represent the book inside of our program so let's start thinking like what are some attributes in a book well one would just be like the title so we can say string title we can also have the author so I could say string author and we can define like number of pages so we could say like that's gonna be an integer like pages and we could also define like the language the book is written in so I could say string language so these are four basic attributes that we can define about our book so basically what I'm saying here is that inside of our program a book is gonna have a title and author a page in a language so a book is going to be composed of a title and author the number of pages and a language so what I want to do now is I want to go out and I want to create instances of this class in other words like this class is just defining like a template of what a book is and we can create individual books inside of our programs and give them you know attributes like title author pages and language so why don't we do that I'm gonna go over to this app Java file and this is where I have my main method and in here I'm gonna create a new book object so basically I'm going to create an instance of that book class I'm just gonna create a book inside of my program so I can just say book so I'm defining the type of data that I want to store so I'm gonna create a book and we'll just say like book one is equal to and we can just say new and book so this is essentially allowing us to create a book inside of our file and down here I can give book one specific attributes so I can basically say like here's the title of the book here's the author of the book here's how many pages it is and here's the language it's written in so I could create this book I'll say like book 1 dot title and we can just set this equal to like Harry Potter and then we'll say book 1 dot author I'll set this equal to JK Rowling we can also say book 1 dot pages so let's say the book has like I don't know 500 pages or something and then the last one was language so we can say book 1 language and that's just gonna be English so essentially what I've done is I've created a book inside of my program and I've given that book certain attribute so I've given it a title given an author of given at pages and I've given it a language so now this book one variable essentially just represents a book inside of our program and if I wanted to I could create another book object and model another book so I'm just gonna come down here and we'll make book 2 so why don't we make this book something else we can just change all these to book 2 and why don't we make this like the 4-hour workweek by Tim Ferriss so the author is gonna be Tim Ferriss and let's say that it's like 300 pages and it's written in English so now inside of our program we have two books that we can use so I can actually print out and access both of these books down here in a print statement so I could say like system dot out dot print line and we can just access like book one dot title so I can come over here and just click the Run button and this will give us the title of the first book which is Harry Potter or we could do like book 2 dot pages and this is how many how many pages are in book two so it's three hundred so essentially what we did is we created a new type of data in our program right we created a book class and then we were able to create instances of that class so we're able to create like individual books that we can represent inside of our program so now I can just represent a book inside my program and I can basically just use it and that's really how classes and objects come in handy 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about constructors in Java and a constructor is basically a special method that we can put inside of a class which will allow us to give that class information when we create it so when I create an object of a specific class I can just give it some information right up front and it'll automatically pop be populated with all of that information so let me show you guys what this is so over here in the last tutorial I actually created a book class and this book class had a few different attributes things like title author pages and language so this is kind of like the overall template for a book in our program and here my app Java file and my main method I created a couple books so I created this first book and it was like a Harry Potter book and I created this other book down here was the 4-hour workweek by Tim Ferriss so I was able to create these two books and it totally worked right I was able to print out attributes of these books and it went really well here's the problem though look how many lines of code this is taken up this is taking up just to create two of these books it's taken up like twelve lines or you know eleven lines of code that's a lot of code and you know imagine that I wanted to create a bunch of these different books like four or five of them this isn't gonna take up a lot of space on my text editor not to mention it's gonna be extremely on inconvenient to have to go through and type out like book one dot title is equal to the title book to book one author is equal to the author like that's super tedious to have to do that and there's actually a way in Java where we can just skip having to do this and when we create this object up here inside of these parentheses we can just pass it all of this information so we can pass it like the title the author and the number of pages and the language we can put all of those up here in these parentheses as parameters and then the object would automatically be created with the title equal to the title that we passed in the author equal to the author that we passed in and you know all the rest of the attributes set and that's called a constructor you'll also hear people call it an initialize method or an init method but usually in Java we'll refer to it as a constructor so over here I'm going to go to this book dot Java file and in here we can create a constructor so a constructor is essentially going to allow us to give our object some default information when we create it and the way that you can create a constructor is just by coming down here and I'm just gonna say public and I want to type out the name of the class so we're just gonna say public book cuz that's the name of the class and I'm gonna give this an open and close parenthesis and an open and closed curly bracket so basically what's happening is this is a constructor and whenever we create a new object so whenever I create a new book object that constructor method is gonna get called so when I say book and I say these open and close parentheses essentially what I'm doing is I'm calling that constructor method so over here this constructor method is directly linked to this guy right here and so I can actually pass this constructor method a bunch of different parameters so I can pass it like a title I could pass it an author and a number of pages and then inside of this constructor method I can take those values and assign them to the values in here so I can set the title of the object equal to the title that got passed in so let me show you guys how this is gonna work and it'll sort of be more clear to you so in here I just want to say that this book is gonna take a bunch of values by default so we're just gonna be the values up here so we'll create a string title string author and int for pages and string for language so here we're basically passing in these four parameter work we're saying that this constructor method needs to have four parameters into it so basically now when we want to create a book we have to give it a title and author the number of pages and the language otherwise we're not going to be able to create it so actually if we go back over here to this app dot Java file you'll see that I'm getting two errors and it's basically saying that we can't create the book this way because we're not giving it those four values that we needed to give it so in order to create a book now we need to give it a title we need to give it an author or we need to give it the number of pages and we need to give it a language we're actually not done in this constructor method so what I need to do now is take the values that got passed into this constructor and I need to assign them to the values up here in other words I need to assign them to the attributes inside of our object so I'm just gonna say this dot title and when I say this dot title it's referring to the title variable up here now remember I had a variable over here called title that got passed into this constructor and so when I use this dot title it refers to the title variable up here and I can just set this equal to title and this variable over here is referring to the variable that got passed in so we can do this for all of these so I can say this author is equal to author and again this is referring to the author up here and this guy is referring to the author they got passed in so we can do the same thing for what was it pages and language so this stuff pages is equal to pages and this dot Ling is equal to language okay so essentially what's happening now is we're passing this constructor some initial information we're taking that information and we're setting it equal to the attributes of our object so let's do this now we can create a new book so now instead of specifying like book one title is equal to Harry Potter book 1 dot author we can just take these values and we can put them in out of this open and closed parentheses so I'll put in our title and then I'll make a comma and we can put in our author so JK rowling we can put in the number of pages which is 500 and then we can pass in the language which was English so now instead of having to type out all of this code to create our book object I only have to type out this one line and this is actually going to be a valid book object so I can do the same thing with the 4-hour workweek book so I can just copy the title we'll paste it into here we can do the same thing with the author and the same thing for the pages so it's like 300 and this is English as well okay so now we have our two objects created and again I can just get rid of all this stuff we don't need it anymore so we went from having like 11 or 12 lines of code so now we only have two lines of codes you can see it saved us a lot of trouble and it's also just a lot more organized so I can you know create these books a lot easier and you'll see down here I can still access the attributes inside of these things so when i refresh this program it's still spinning out like 300 I could access the title of book 1 and it's still gonna work so this is still working it's doing exactly what we had before but it's just making it a lot simpler and so that's kind of the beauty of constructors is you can allow the person creating the object to give it some default information and that can be really awesome and it can honestly save you a lot of space and save you a lot of time 



in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to create a multiple-choice quiz in Java so we're gonna write a program that's going to allow a user to basically take a multiple-choice quiz and as they're taking that quiz we'll be able to keep track of like what questions they get right which ones they get wrong and then we'll be able to like grade the quiz and give them a grade at the end so this is gonna be really cool and we're gonna use a lot of different things that we've learned so far in Java we're gonna use things like classes we're gonna use for loops we're gonna use if statements we're gonna use a bunch of stuff to do this so the first thing that I want to do is I want to actually show you guys what I have over here so I just have two questions that I created the first one is what color are apples and the options are a red and green B orange or C magenta it's a pretty easy quiz the other question is what color are bananas and it's like red green yellow or blue so this is like the text for like questions that I want to ask but actually the first thing I want to do is create a java class and I want to create a class which can represent a question for our multiple-choice quiz so a question really has two attributes it has the question prompt and then it has the question answer so there's these two attributes and I want to be able to store those inside of a class so I'm basically gonna say new and we're gonna create a class and we're gonna create a class called question and so down here we'll just click finish and over here we're gonna define our question class so I'm basically going to create two attributes inside of this question class the first is going to be a string so it's gonna be the prompt and the second thing is just going to be the answer so we'll have like the prompt for the question and we'll have the answer to the question and I'm actually gonna create an initialize method so we can initialize this object so I can just say public question and inside here I'm gonna to parameters we're gonna accept the prompt and we're also gonna accept the answer and I just want to say this stop prompt is equal to prompts and this stop answer is equal to answer so basically what I'm doing is I'm accepting input and whatever the user passes into this method is gonna get stored as the questions prompt and the questions answer so we can use this method to basically like give this object some initial value summation so we have our question class and now I'm gonna head over to my app dot Java file and I basically want to create two questioned objects and I want to show you guys how we can create an array of questions so this is going to be kind of cool so I'm basically just gonna say question and I'm gonna use these open and close square brackets and that basically means that I want to create an array of questions so I'm gonna create two questions and we'll store them inside of an array so I'm gonna say question and we'll just call this questions and we'll just set it equal to our array so inside of this array I'm basically going to create two questioned objects so the first thing I'm gonna do is create our first question so I'm gonna say new question and inside of parentheses I want to pass this question all the values that I want it to have so I can just say the prompt is gonna just be q1 from up here so I can just say q1 and the answer to q1 is a right so the answer to what color our apples is red green so we're just gonna say a and that's our first question and again we're creating an array of questions so now I'm going to use this comma we'll come down here and create our next question so I can just say new question and we're gonna pass in q2 so that's gonna be the prompt and we're also gonna pass in the answer so the answer to what color our bananas is be yellow so B is going to be the correct answer so basically I've created in a of questions and the first question is just the question that corresponds to this first prompt and the second question is just the one that corresponds to this second prompt so we're actually doing pretty well we have an array with all of our questions in it now here comes the difficult part we're actually gonna have to let the user take the test and we're gonna have to like grade it as we go so what I want to do is actually create a new method and we're gonna make a method which is basically just gonna be called take test and it'll allow us to take this test so I'm gonna come down here and we'll basically just say public static void we're not gonna return anything and then I'm just gonna say take test so this method will accept one parameter and that parameter is gonna be an array of questions so we want to pass it that array of questions that we created so I'm just gonna say question open and close square brackets and we'll just call this questions so what I'm doing here is I'm accepting a parameter which is an array of questions and that's exactly what we created up here you see we created an array of questions and actually I don't need to something going down so inside of this method we're basically gonna take all the questions and we're gonna ask the user each individual question and depending on if the user gets the question right or wrong we're gonna increment a variable which keeps track of their score so I'm gonna create a variable and it's just gonna be an integer it's gonna be call it score and I'll set it equal to zero so the user will start off with zero points they haven't gotten any questions right now what we need to do is we need to actually ask the questions so what I want to do is create a for loop and we're just gonna loop through each one of these questions and we're gonna ask the user so I'm gonna say for int I is equal to zero I is less than questions dot length so basically less than the number of questions that we have and then just plus plus so make an open and close curly bracket and now inside of this for loop we want to do a couple things basically we want to ask the user the question we want to be able to get their answer and we want to check to see if that answer is right and if that answer is right we'll increment the score if the answer is wrong and then we won't increment the score so first things first is we need to create a Java scanner we need to be able to get input from the user and the way that we do that is by creating a scanner so I'm just gonna say scanner keyboard input is equal to new scanner system dot in and this is actually gonna throw an error because we have to import the scanner class into our java file and if I'm on eclipse I can just hover over here and click this import button and this will actually do it for me so now you can see up here at the top of the file it's importing Java util dot scanner alright so now that we have our scanner setup we're actually going to be able to get input from the user so the first thing I want to do is write out the prompt so I want to like prompt the user with the question I want to give them the question so I'm just gonna say system dot out dot print and we can just say print line and inside of here we want to basically just print out the question we want to print out the prompt for the question so I can actually access the specific question that we're looping through by saying questions i dot prompt so in each iteration through this loop we're going to be accessing a different questions prompt then what we want to do is we want to create a variable to store their answers string answer is equal to input whoops keyboard input dot next line and this is basically just gonna grab whatever the user enters in and store it as our answer finally what we want to do is check to see if that answer is correct so I want to compare that answer to the answer to the question and we'll be able to see if they got it right so I can just say if and we want to again compare the answer to the answer to the actual answer to the question so I could say if answer dot equals and I basically just want to check to see if it's equal to the answer to the question inside the questions array so I can just say questions i dot answer so this is going to compare the answer that they just entered to the answer for the specific question and now inside here if the got the answer right so if this is true that means they got the answer right we can just say score plus plus so we'll add one to their score and once we're done with this for loop that means that they've gone through all the questions and we've graded them so I'm just gonna print out I'll just say system dot out dot print line and we can just print out their score so I can say you've got and well basically it's like you got like two out of three or like five out of ten or you know however many questions they got out of the possible question so we can say you got score and we'll just say out of and now we just want to put the total number of questions as they were asked so we can say questions dot length and this should basically give us exactly what we need so let's see how we did hopefully we typed everything out correctly actually I need to move this up online so that should be right in there so we have our take test method which basically can take an array of questions and it will ask the questions and grade the test now let's head back up here and what I want to do is I want to actually call this method so I'm gonna go ahead and call the method so I'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna say take test and we'll just pass in this array of questions that we just made so questions and now we should be able to go through and take this test hopefully everything works this is kind of a complicated program but we'll see if we got it right I'm just gonna click the Run button and you can see over here it's asking me the question so it's saying okay here's the first question what color are apples so pressures on let's see if we can get the answer right I'm going to type in a hit enter okay now here's our next question what color are bananas this is a tough one to say be yellow so we typed in the answers and now it says you got two out of two cool so we got 100% on the quiz let's see what happens when we get one wrong so let's say what our apples will say see magenta and bananas we'll get that one right so we'll say yellow now it's gonna say you got one out of two so no matter how many questions I get right it's always gonna tell me like how I did on the test so this was kind of a lot of code and I'm gonna walk you guys through it one more time just so we can see exactly what we did what I started with was basically two question prompts so I had two questions in mind that I wanted to ask and I stored them in these string variables then what I did is I created a class to represent a question on our test and this class had two attributes its have the question prompt and then it had the answer to the question and I created this initialize method down here so I could easily create the question object over here in this app dot Java file I created an array of questions so the array actually stored two different questions inside of it so we put this first question in here and we basically basically just created the question by saying new question we pass it in the prompt and we passed in the answer and then I created another question by saying new question we pass in the prompts and again we passed in the answer and then I came down here and I called this take test method and I gave it that array of questions so this take test method accepted the array of questions it created an integer called score and then we created a scanner and the scanner is really just used so we can get input from the user and down here inside this for loop this is where all the magic happens this is like the most important part of our entire program it's basically looping through all of the questions inside of that question arrey so it's just looping through every single question that we gave it and for every single question it's printing out the questions prompt so the first time through this loop it's printing out the first questions prompt the second time through the loop it's printing out the second questions prompt it's printing out the prompt for each question and then what it's doing is it's getting the answer that the user inputs so whatever answered the user input that's gonna go grab that answer store it inside of this answer variable finally what it's going to do is it's going to check to see if the user got that answer right so it's going to check to see if the answer that they entered is equal to the answer of the question that was asked and we can access the answer of the question that was asked by just saying questions square brackets I and if that was true we incremented the score and so we just went through that loop as many times as there were questions and then after we were done we just printed out the score that they got so I know that's a lot of code and if it doesn't fully make sense that's okay you know write your own little question-and-answer program and see if you can figure out how to do something similar to this and really here's the thing the only way that you're gonna learn this stuff is just by going in and playing around with it and you know honestly breaking it and then trying to fix it and breaking and try to fix it so don't be afraid to go in and try to build something like this yourself trust me you'll learn a lot 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about class methods in Java class methods are basically methods that you can put inside of a Java class and they can help that class to become more powerful and to perform specific functions so over here I've actually created a class called student and this is a really simple class and basically just like models a student for our program so it'll say like student and we have three attributes named major and GPA so this is like a very simple class and you'll see down here I have this constructor or this initialized method and I'm passing in three values so name major GPA and I'm basically just giving all of these values some initial values so let's say that we wanted to create a student object I can come over to app Java and we can create a new student so I can say student my student and we can just set it equal to new student and we can pass it some initial attributes right so I think the first one was name so we can say me so it would be Mike and then I think the second one was major so we can just say like computer science and finally we're gonna pass it a GPA so why don't we pass it a GPA of 3.2 okay so we've passed it all the information and we now have this student awesome so I'm gonna show you guys how we can use class methods in order to do something cool with this student class so over here in this student class let's say that we wanted to have a way where we could figure out if the student was on the honor roll or not right so we create a student over here we give it a name we give it a major and we give it a GPA so we're not telling it whether or not it's on the honor roll let's say that there's a certain rule for honors for in order to have honors you have to have a GPA of 3.5 or a but let's just say about how that's how it works well in this student class I could create a method which would tell us whether or not the current student honors so I'm gonna come down here and I can create a method just like this I can just say public and we're gonna make this a boolean so I can just say public boolean and we want to give this method a name and basically it's gonna return a boolean value true or false and I'm just gonna call this is on on roll so this method is gonna tell us whether or not the current student is on the honor roll and I'm just gonna make an open and closed curly bracket now inside of here I can actually use some of the information about this specific object in order to tell so remember the rules for the honor roll is if you have a GPA of 3.5 or above then you're technically considered on the honor roll so we can just say if this dot GPA and when I use this keyword right here it's referring to this GPA up here so it's referring to this variable and remember when we created the object we gave it an initial value that the user passed in over here so I can say this dot GPA so if this GPA is greater than or equal to three point five then we know the users on the honor roll so we can just return true otherwise we can just return false so if this if condition wasn't true we didn't return true then we'll just go ahead and return false so now what I can do is I can head over to my app dot Java file and with this new student I could actually check to see if they're on the honor roll so I can say like system dot out dot print line and inside of here we're basically just going to access our student so we'll say my student and we can just execute that method that's inside of that student class so I can say dot is on honor roll and I can just access it like this and I need to use these open and close parentheses just like I normally would when calling a function and my student dot is on honor roll will give us a true or a false value basically telling us if the student is on the so I can run this program and you'll see over here we get false so I passed this a GPA of 3.2 so the student doesn't qualify for the Honor Roll but if I was to pass this like at 3.6 now when I run the program this should be true because the student has a GPA that qualifies him or her for the Honor Roll and this is kind of how class methods can come in handy you can create these little methods inside of your classes which perform certain functions so in our case this method told us whether or not the student was on the honor roll based on just some arbitrary rules that we created and so you can create as many of these different methods as you want inside of your classes and they can be really useful for performing specific functions on those objects 


In this tutorial I want to talk to you about getters and setters in Java a getters and setters are certain methods that we can put inside of our classes which allow us to control how other programs access and interact with those classes so this is kind of an interesting idea we can basically use getters and setters to act as a middleman so let's say somebody creates an object from a class we created and they want to like set a specific value in that object or they want to get a specific value from that object we can use getters and setters to essentially just act as a middleman so I'm going to show you guys everything you need to know about getters and setters and we'll really just talk about like why they're useful so over here in my program I've created this class and it's a movie class so basically what this does is it acts as like a movie data type for our program so this is like representing a movie inside of our program and this class has three attributes it has a title it has a director and it has a rating so we're basically defining a movie in terms of you know the title of the director and the rating right this is our class the template for a movie and then down here I just have this constructor which basically creates the movie class and I want to show you guys how we can normally just communicate with this class so over here on my app dot Java file in my main method I've actually created two movies so I made a movie called movie one and it's just the Avengers and the director is Joss Whedon and the rating is pg-13 I also created another movie called movie - and it's stepbrothers the director is Adam McKay and it's rated R so I'm have two movies now and I'm able to represent the information about those movies using these objects right so I have two movie objects and this is pretty cool right everything is going well and I want to show you guys how I could interact with these so I could say like system.out.print line and we could actually access specific information about these movies so I could say like movie one title right and this will print out the title of the first movie so it's the Avengers I could do the same thing with movie two but we could do it for like director and we'll be able to print out the director we could do the same for the rating as well so this will print out the rating so I'm able to interact with this object I'm able to get any of the attributes from the object that I want just by accessing them directly like this I can also set the attributes so for example let's say I wanted to change the rating for Avengers so let's say we didn't like that it was rated pg-13 we want it to be rated PG I could come in here and say movie one dot rating is equal to PG and you'll see now when we type movie 1 rating and we print it out to the screen instead of being pg-13 I just changed it so now it's gonna be rated PG and you see we get that over here what I could also do though is I could really put anything in here I want it I could put for example something that's not a valid rating I could just put like a dog in here now dog isn't one of the ratings that we can give to a movie and yet I'm still able to do it over here and this is kind of the problem that I want to address in this video and this is kind of a situation where we could use getters and setters to solve a problem the rating of a movie can really only it's only supposed to have like certain values right we have like a G rating a PG rating pg-13 R and sometimes a movie can be like not rated right so these are essentially like the you know the general ratings for movies maybe there's a couple other ones not forgetting but for our case let's just say that these are all the possible ratings for a movie well when I created this movie object I was able to give it a rating that wasn't one of these right I was able to basically say like movie rating is equal to dog I could have put whatever I wanted in there right there's no there's nothing controlling you know what I can put inside of the rating field and that's kind of a problem and a lot of times when you create a class you're going to want to enforce certain rules so for example when I create this movie class I'm gonna want to say like hey you can only give a certain you know number of ratings like these are the only valid ratings that we can give to a movie so the question becomes how do we do that and we can actually do that using things called getters and setters so I'm going to show you guys how we can create getters and setters let's go over to our movie class and inside this movie class the main problem we're dealing with is this rating right in other words the Java program that creates a radio a movie object is able to set this rating to whatever they want so if I want to control what we can put in here as a rating I can use something called a setter and a setter is basically a method that an outside program will use in order to modify this rating attribute so I can basically create a center by coming down here and I'm gonna create a new method inside of this class so I'm just gonna say public and generally when you're creating a setter you want to use this naming convention so you want to say set and then you want to say the name of the attribute that you're setting so in our case it's gonna be rating so I'm just gonna say set rating and actually we're gonna need to put void here as well so public void set rating inside of this parentheses I want to allow the user to pass in a parameter so they're gonna pass in the rating that they want to give to this movie right so over here we can just make this a string so it's just string rating now inside of this method what I can do is I can say this dot rating and this guy right here is referring to the rating up here so I can say the rating attribute in this class is equal to a rating and so essentially what I'm doing is I'm creating a method that the user can use in order to give a value to this rating attribute but here's the thing though we still have the same problem right in other words over here in this app dot Java file I can still use that set rating method and I can give it whatever I so I could come over here and say movie one dot set rating and I could pass it dog again and it's still gonna work so movie one dot rating is still gonna be allowed to be dog you'll see over here it's the same thing so really using that setter method didn't solve the problem but here's how we can solve the problem inside of this set rating method I can actually enforce what ratings are allowed so I can come over here and I can say basically like if the rating isn't g PG pg-13 R or NR then essentially we have an invalid rating so I'm gonna make like an if statement to check that so I can basically just say if and I'm just going to want to check a bunch of different conditions so we can just say like if rating dot equals and I'm just going to check to see if this is equal to any of the valid rating so I can say if rating dot equals G or and now I'm just going to check PG so we'll say or rating dot equals PG and this is going to be kind of a long line of code or rating equals pg-13 or rating equals R or rating equals NR so I'm basically checking to see if the rating is equal to any of these valid ratings right these are all the valid ratings that we allow for so G PG pg-13 R and NR that make sense so we're basically saying like if it's equal to one of the valid ratings then we're just gonna set it equal to set it normally so I can say this stop rating is equal to rating right so I'm giving it the rating that the user passed in otherwise though we can do something else so I could say else and in the case that it's not equal to one of the valid ratings why don't we just set it equal to NR so I'll just say this dot rating is equal to naught so if they don't give us a valid rating I'm just gonna say okay let's just say that it's not rated because they didn't put in a valid rating so essentially what we're doing is we're controlling the way that you can set a rating so we're controlling what ratings are valid to set so now when I go over here into my app dot Java file and you'll notice down here I'm saying movie one dot set rating dog when we print out movie one dot rating you'll notice that instead of printing out dog we're gonna print out NR and so if I didn't put a valid rating inside of here then it didn't set that invalid rating it just set it to NR but if I put like a valid rating like pg-13 now when I wanna run the program it's gonna allow it to be pg-13 because that's a valid rating so this set rating method is essentially acting as a middleman between the person creating the object and the actual object itself so we can control what values are set on certain attributes like rating but there's actually one more problem with how we've set this up which is I can still come in here and I can just access the rating directly so I could come in here and I could say movie one dot rating is equal to dog and this is still gonna be able to set it because we're just setting it directly so you'll see here I'm able to set it equal to dog and we need to actually do one more thing in either in order to fully set this up I'm gonna come over here into this movie Java class and right in front of this rating attribute I want to put a special keyword in Java which is called private so I'm gonna say private string rating and when I put this private key word in front of string rating essentially what it means is it means that this rating attribute can only be accessed by this movie class so if I'm writing code in a file that's outside of this movie class in other words if I'm writing code inside of this app dot Java file I'm not going to be able to access this rating at should be directly so I'm I'm there's no situation where I'm gonna be able to modify this so if we come back over to this app dot Java file you'll see that I'm getting an error here when I try to access it it says the field movie dot rating is not visible that basically just means that I don't have access to it so I can't actually give this a value directly anymore the only way that I can change the value of rating is by using that set rating method so I have to say set rating and I have to put the argument inside of here so I have to say like set rating and then give it the rating and essentially what happens now is I'm not able to give it an invalid value so the only way I can set the rating is by using this method and remember that method is gonna filter out any bad ratings and just set them equal to not rated so we've basically allowed the attribute inside of that class to only have specific values and that's really powerful and that's sort of one of the core tenants of creating classes is that we want to create these getters and setters in order to control the access to the individual attributes of our classes and so essentially what I want to do is I want to take this set rating idea and I want to apply it to every single attribute in my class right so down here I have this set rating method but I want to make one of these for every single attribute in the class so I want to make one for title and director as well so why don't we come down here and we'll do that we'll say public set title and actually this needs to be void and inside of here we're just gonna pass in a title and then here's the thing for title it can really be anything we want it to be so I'm just gonna say this title is equal to title because we don't really have to filter this one out and the same thing with director so I can say public void set director string director and down here I'm just gonna say this dot director is equal to director so I'm setting this attribute and we can do the same thing for getting an attribute so in addition to controlling how a user is gonna set a certain attribute in our class we also want to control how they're going to access a certain attribute in our class so if you'll notice if I come back over to my apt Java file I can't actually access this rating anymore you see here I'm trying to access movie one dot rating and it's giving me an error it's saying the field movie dot rating is not visible because I made this rating attribute private I can't access it directly anymore I can't even like I don't even really know that it's there in my other file so I need to create a getter method which is going to allow me to get this so right here below the set method I'm just gonna say public string get rating and in here I'm just going to return rating and so now if I want to access the rating all I have to do is come down here and say movie one get rating and now I'll be able to get the rating for the movie so I want to create a setter method and a getter method for every single one of these attributes so here's the set title we'll also create a get title and I'll do the same thing for director so I'll just say alright so now I've created a getter and a setter for all the attributes inside of my class so the last step is to come up here and I want to make all of these attributes private so I'm just gonna say private string title and private string directors so essentially what I'm doing is I'm closing off access to each one of these attributes in the class and now whenever somebody who creates a movie object wants to access or set any of these attributes they have to go through these methods that I created so if they want to get an attribute they have to go through the get rating method if they want to set an attribute they have to go through this set attribute and essentially what that allows you to do is just control the access so in a lot of cases you'll notice for example this set title method it's not actually doing anything that we wouldn't have already done right it's not doing anything special but the point is if at any time I wanted to make this do something special I could do that operation inside of here and I wouldn't have to change any other code but I want to show you guys how we can also use these inside of our constructors so down here I have this movie constructor and it just has a few attributes like title director and rating and you'll notice down here I'm only setting them equal to whatever the user passes in right so basically what this means is it's possible for a outside program to create a movie object that has a rating that doesn't conform to the rating rules that we specified down here and that's a problem so what I can actually do is I can take these and I can replace them with the setters so instead of saying this dot title is equal to title what I can actually just say is this dot set title and inside of here I can pass in the title that they passed in and I can do this for all of these attributes so I can say this dot set director and inside here I can just pass director and finally we can just do it for rating so I can say this stop rating whoops this dot set rating and I'll just pass the rating so now instead of just having these be accessed or set directly we'll set them using these set methods and this is a really good way to set up your constructors you know using the set methods in order to do it so now if I was to create a movie object with a rating that was different than G PG pg-13 R or NR it's just gonna set it equal to NR so we're basically you know tightening up the class so the outside object can only do what we want it to do 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about static attributes in classes now a static attribute is basically just an attribute of a class that is the same for all of the objects of that class so we can define a static attribute or a static variable inside of our class and then all of the objects in that class will be able to access and have that same value so this is a little bit of an abstract concept and really to fully understand it I think I need to show you an example just so you can kind of wrap your mind around it so over here and my text editor I've actually created a Java class and I've created a Java class for a song so you can see down here it says public class song so this class is basically just modeling a song inside of our program so I could store three different pieces of information about a song we can store the title of the song the artist who wrote the song and we can store the length of the song so this is gonna be like how many seconds the song is and this is just gonna be an integer then down here I have a constructor and this constructor allows other programs to create song objects so you can create an individual song using this overall song template and finally down here I have some getters and setters and whenever you create a class in Java it's always always always a good idea to use getters and setters there's really no reason not to and especially in a language like Java most people are gonna expect you to have getters and setters for all of the attributes so what I want to do is show you how we can create a couple songs so over here I'm actually gonna create a couple different songs so I went ahead and created two song objects so I basically made two songs inside of my java program and the first one is just called holiday and it says new song and this is just the title is holiday the artist is Green Day and I'm just saying it's 200 seconds long and I have another song called American Idiot and the title is American Idiot the artist is Green Day and it's 168 seconds long so I now have two songs inside of my program so if I wanted to print out some information about these songs I could just say system dot out dot print line and let's say that I wanted to print out holiday get artists and what this is gonna do is it's basically gonna print out the artists for the holiday song so now when I run my program it should print out Green Day and I could also do a similar thing for American Idiot so I could come down here and why don't we print out American Idiot dot get title so I'm printing out these two different attributes of these objects so let's come up here and we'll also print out holiday get title so these two objects have different information so the title for the first object for this holiday object is different from the title for the American Idiot object they're both the same type of object they're both song objects but they both have different attributes so the title of the artist in the length for the one object is different from the title the artist in the length for the other object so what I'm trying to make is when you create an object you're giving it these attributes but those attributes are different across the objects so for one object the attributes are different from another object now that's how it works when we're using just normal attributes you know these things like string title string artist string length but there's actually a special type of attribute that we can use inside of our class which is called a static attribute and basically what that means is this is an attribute that's gonna be the same across all of the objects that we create for the song class so any song objects that I create that static attribute is gonna be the same for all of them so they'll all share that same attribute so let me kind of give you an example of how we use something like this so let's come over here and I'm just gonna create a static attribute so I'm gonna make an attribute which counts how many songs have been created in our program so let's say that inside of this song class I just wanted to keep track of how many times a new song has been created so how many song objects are out there what I could say is private and now instead of specifying the data type I would just want to say static so I'm saying private static and now after that static keyword I can specify the data type so I could say int and we'll call this songs count and I'm just gonna set this equal to zero initially so we're creating a static attribute which is a private attribute and it's an integer and I'm calling it songs count and I'm giving it an initial value of zero because this is a static attribute this is gonna be the same for all of the objects that I create from this song class so let me demonstrate this I'm gonna come down here into this constructor and remember this constructor gets called every single time we create a new song so anytime I create a song object I'm calling this constructor and so down here what I can do is every time we create a new song I can increment this song's count so I could say songs count plus plus and that's gonna increment this song's count every time we create a new song and down here I'm just gonna print something out so I'll say system dot out dot print line and I'm just gonna print out song count and I'll just print out songs count so now that we've created this song count plus plus and also that we've printed out song count so printing out the value of the song count now when I go back over to my app dot Java file which has this main method in it and I create these two objects so actually I'm gonna get rid of these print statements so all I'm doing is creating these two songs holiday and Emeric idiot what you'll notice is this is gonna print out twice so when I run this program it prints out song count 1 and it prints out song count 2 when I created the holiday object that constructor method got called and it added 1 to the song count so when I created holiday we went over to this constructor we incremented the song count we printed it out then when I created this American Idiot object we went over to this constructor we incremented the song count from 1 to 2 and then we printed it out so every single time I create a new song it's gonna increment that count and it's gonna know how many objects we've already created that's why we're able to get to here so just to make this a little bit more obvious I'm gonna come down here and I want to make another get method so I'm just gonna say public int get song's count and this is just gonna tell us what the song's count is so I'm just gonna say return songs count and this will tell us how many songs have been created so over here in my app dot Java file I can come down here and I'm just gonna print out holiday dot get songs count it's gonna tell me what the song count is for holiday I'm also gonna do the same for American Idiot so down here we'll just say American Idiot so when I run this program now you'll see we're creating the two songs right so when we create this holiday song the counts 1 because we've only have one song when I create the American Idiot song the counts 2 because now we have two songs when I come down here and I access holiday get song count an American Idiot get songs count we're getting the same value so over here we're getting two and that's because at the time we're printing these out we actually have two song so these both have the same attribute there's they're accessing that same songs count even though there are different instances of song they're using that same attribute and that's what a static attribute is it's a variable or a value that is the same across all of the objects in a class so just to really drive on this point I'm gonna make another song so I'll just copy this again and I'm gonna make the song down here after we print this out so Africa and it's gonna be called Africa by toto and I don't know how long it is let's say it's like 300 seconds whatever so I'm creating this new song and I'm also gonna print out the value of American Idiot get song's count I'm gonna print out the value of holiday get songs count and I'm also gonna print out the value for Africa I get songs count so a lot of stuff should be printing out let's see what we get I'm gonna click this Run button so when we create our holiday object the song count is 1 when we create our American Idiot object the song count is 2 when I print out the song count for holiday and American Idiot we get 2 now I'm adding a new song so this new Africa by toto song the song counts now 3 and when I print out all of these attributes get song's count for each one of these individual objects they're all going to be 3 so they're all using the same attribute across the class so any songs are gonna have the same songs count so that is a static attribute these are extremely important in Java and there's a lot of circumstances where you're gonna want to use them so just to recap I created this attribute by saying private so like usually it's gonna be either private or public and then I specified it as static and I used this int keyword 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about static methods inside of the classes now a static method is basically a method that can be accessed from inside of a class without creating an instance of that class so generally when we have a class we're gonna create an object of that class so we're basically say hey here's our class it's a template for a specific you know entity in our program and we're gonna create a specific instance of that entity so if I had like a book class right I could create a specific book with like a specific title a specific author or a specific number of pages and that's sort of like the general use case but there's also something we can do which is create a class that has static methods and then what we can do is we can just access those static methods from anywhere we want and we don't have to create an instance of that class so let me explain this to you obviously that's kind of a long-winded explanation so I'm just going to show you guys an example a good example of this is the Java math class if you guys have ever done anything with math in Java you'll know that there is a math class and we can use specific methods in that math class so I'm just gonna write out a print statement just so we can see what's going on and there is a class in Java which is called math and all I have to do to access it if I can just say math and I can say math dot and then you can see down here I have all these options for different methods I can use so there's you know a bunch of stuff here let's say we wanted to use a math function or a math method called Max and basically what this method does is you pass it two numbers and it'll spit out the maximum so I could pass it three and six and we're gonna get back that 6 because 6 is the greater of the two numbers now this might seem a little weird to you generally when we use classes we create objects right so you might think I'd have to create a math object like I'd have to go math my math is equal to new math right you might think that I would have to do that in order to use this math class right in order to create an instance of this class but the math class is actually special in that it's storing static methods and a static method is a method that we can use without having to create an instance of this math class so let me show you guys how this works I'm gonna create my own class and it's gonna basically do exactly what that math class is doing so I'm just gonna come over here and we'll create a new class so I'll say new class and I'm just gonna give this a name so why don't we just call this prints because this is gonna print out some cool stuff for us and down here I'm just gonna click finish so now we have this new class called prints right public class prints now if I want to do something like we did with that math class I can actually create specific methods inside of here and I can give them the static keyword so I could say public static and we could create a method in here that just print something out so I'll say say goodbye so this method will just say goodbye to us so in here we can just print something out goodbye what you'll see is now I can actually go over to my app dot Java file over here and I can just access this directly so I could just say prints dot say goodbye so I didn't have to create a prints object I didn't have to say like prints my prints is equal to new prints it's right I didn't have to do that in order to use this method I didn't have to create a prints object all I had to do was just say prints dot say goodbye and now it's gonna go ahead and run that method for us and it's gonna say goodbye so what I could do is I could put as many of these little methods inside of here as I wanted I could put like two or three dozen methods in here and then when I wanted to access them all I'd have to do is just access the class so I'd say prints and then access the method so this is another you know a use case it's another way that we can use classes and a lot of times you're gonna want to create classes that are just gonna store methods or just gonna store different attributes so I could also put an attribute inside of this class again I'm gonna have to make it static I can say public static and we could say like the in miles so this will tell me how many feet are inside of a mile so it's like 5,280 I think and this needs to be an integer and so I could actually access this piece of information from inside of this so I could just say like prints dot feet and mile and this would tell me that information so in addition to use just using classes and creating objects from those classes we can also use classes to store like different methods or different variables different attributes and that can honestly be really useful inside of your java program so you know don't just think that classes are only for the purposes of you know being instantiated into objects classes can also just be used to store a bunch of different methods it's a bunch of different attributes just like that math class right the math class all it does is gives us access to a bunch of these different methods which you can see down here and a lot of times something like that will come in handy inside of Java 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about inheritance specifically we're gonna be looking at the extends keyword in Java we're gonna talk about how we can extend the functionality of a class into another class this is a really cool feature in Java and when you're creating a lot of classes and you're using different class structures in Java this can come in handy a lot so I'm gonna show you guys an example we're gonna talk about what this is and why it's awesome so over here in my files I've created a file called chef dot Java and this is a class that's just called chef and inside of this class we basically have three methods so we have this make chicken method we have this make salad method and we have this make special dish method so these are three methods that would correspond to a chef right a chef can do let's say our chef can do three things you make chicken he can make salad and you can make a special dish and inside of each one of these methods we're basically just printing out some text so these are really simple methods but they're just here to kind of illustrate the point I'm trying to make so a for example and make chicken it's just system dot print line it says the chef makes a delicious chicken and make salad it just says the chef makes a healthy salad and make special dish it just says the chef makes barbecue ribs so here's our basic chef class you know the chef can do three things make chicken mix out or make a special dish over here in my app dot Java file and I have my main method over here I've actually created a chef so it's just called normal chef and I set it equal to a new chef all right so I just created a new instance of the chef class I created a chef object and what I can do now is I can actually perform some of those operations so I can say hey normal chef why don't you make chicken so when I call this make chicken method you'll see over here on the screen we should print out the chef makes a delicious chicken so I told the chef to make a chicken and he did so then I can also say chef dot make salad and the chef will make a salad so let's press play and you can see it says the chef makes a healthy salad I can also make the special dish normal chef make special dish and this should make the barbecue ribs so our normal chef can make a variety of dishes now let's say that we wanted to model another type of chef in our program so let's say that in addition to just creating a normal sort of generic chef we also wanted to create an Italian chef well I can come over here and I'm just gonna make a new class so I'll make a class called Italian chef and we can just click finish and this is gonna create an Italian chef class for us so you can see here we have this Italian chef Java file and we have this public class Italian chef so now we're dealing with another chef right so let's say that our Italian chef can cook everything that the normal chef could cook so our normal chef can cook chicken salad and a special dish and let's say that our Italian chef can also cook chicken salad and a special dish but in addition to those three dishes the Italian chef can also cook spaghetti so one thing I can do is just I can come over here and I can just write out all of those methods again right so I could come to this chef class and we'll copy all of these methods because remember the Italian chef can do everything the normal chef can do so I'll copy all these methods I'll put them in over here so now the Italian chef is able to make solid chicken and a special dish and he's able to make one more thing which is spaghetti so we'll add another method public void make pasta and in here it's just gonna basically print out like the chef makes pasta so here we have a method and the chef is now able to make pasta but let's also say that this chef wants to have a different special dish so that normal chef was able to make barbecue ribs as the special dish but let's say that the Italian chef is gonna make eggplant parm so so now when we use this special dish the chef is going to make eggplant parm so head back over to our app dot Java file and I'm just going to copy this so we'll make another chef Italian chef right now down here we can say Italian chef dot make special dish so you see up here we're saying normal chef make special dish down here we're saying Italian chef dot makes special dish so if I play this we'll see the normal chef makes barbecue ribs and the other chef makes eggplant parm but you'll notice that I can use all the same methods inside of this Italian chef as I did inside the normal chef so down here I can say like Italian chef made chicken and this Italian chefs gonna be able to make chicken right can make a delicious check-in and also we have that additional attribute which would be to make pasta so we can say Italian chef top make pasta and it just says the chef makes pasta ok so essentially what happened here was I created a normal chef and then I created another type of chef which is an Italian chef now let's say that we want to create one more type of chef so we're gonna create a Chinese chef so I'm gonna make another class so I make one more class and we're just gonna say Chinese chef so this person will be cooking Chinese food and we click finish so now we have our Chinese chef and let's say once again the Chinese chef is gonna be able to do everything that that normal chef can do so the Chinese chef can make chicken can make salad and can make a special dish I'm just gonna take all of those methods and I'm just gonna paste them in here and now once again let's say that the Chinese chef can also make an additional dish so the Chinese chef can make fried rice so we can say public void make fry and rice and this is just basically just gonna print out the chef makes fried rice so this Chinese chef in addition to being able to make chicken salad and special dish can also make fried rice and let's say that we want the special dish to instead of being barbecue ribs be orange chicken all right so we have a Chinese chef we have an Italian chef and we just have normal chef and over here in my app dot Java file again I can just create an object for our Chinese chef Chinese chef and again this chef can do everything that those other two chefs can do except it can't make eggplant parm like the Italian chef and it has a different special dish alright so essentially what I did was I created three classes and what I want you guys to notice about these classes is they have similar methods so this chef class has three methods this Italian chef has those same three methods and the Chinese chef has those same three methods but what I did was I basically just copy and pasted the methods from this normal chef into the Italian chef and into the Chinese chef and this is kind of a lot of work right if I wanted to create another chef for example like a French chef I would have to do the same exact thing I'd have to copy and paste all of those methods from the chef class into that new French chef class so this is a situation where we can use something called inheritance an inheritance is basically where a certain Java class can inherit other methods from another Java class so for example this Chinese chef class would be able to inherit this make chicken class this makes salad class and this makes special dish class from the chef class so it wouldn't actually have to include them in here so let me show you guys how this works inside this Chinese chef I can actually just get rid of make chicken make salad and make special discs I'm just gonna delete them okay so a hundred percent up front they're just gone what I can do over here is I can say public class so after I say the name of our class Chinese chef I can use a special reserved word in Java called extends I can say ext EMDs and now I can type in the name of the class that I want to extend so I can say chef and essentially what I'm doing here is I'm extending all of the functionality from the chef class so over here this chef Java file has a make chicken method a make salad method and a make special dish method and essentially by saying extends this Chinese chef class is actually going to have all of those functions included inside of it automatically so let me show you guys how this works I'm gonna come over here to this Chinese chef object and you'll notice that inside of the Chinese chef class I don't have a method method called make chicken or make salad but I can still access that method inside of this object so I can say Chinese chef make salad and when I print this out to the screen you'll see it says the chef makes a healthy salad so down here this is the Chinese chef is able to make a healthy salad so I'm able to use all of the functionality from that normal chef from that chef class inside of the Chinese chef class and that's basically just saving me a lot of time I don't have to like physically copy all of these methods and put them over into here I can just extend the functionality of the chef class and they're included automatically also then I can include custom methods so for example I can include this make fried rice method inside the Chinese chef even though it's not included in the chef class so I have all of the functionality of the chef class with the eyelid added functionality of being able to make fried rice but if you guys remember there is also the situation with the special dish so this chef over here is making a special dish making barbecue ribs but if you remember the Chinese chef had actually changed this so the Chinese chef special dish was orange chicken what you can do when you're extending a class is you can actually override some of the methods so what I could do is I could copy this make special dish method from inside of the Chef Java file and then over here in the Chinese chef Java file I can just make my own special dish method so over here I can say the chef makes orange chicken and now this makes special dish method inside of the Chinese chef class is gonna override the make special dish method that we got from the chef class so if I came over to my app of a file I could say Chinese chef make special dish and the Chinese chef is now going to be making orange chicken instead of those barbecue ribs so you can see here chef makes it on chicken so if I don't like one of the methods that I'm getting from the class that I'm extending from I can just override it like we did here in the Chinese chef class so I could do the same thing with this Italian chef class right I could basically just get rid of make chicken and make salad because those two methods are gonna be the same and you'll notice here I'm still overriding this makes special dish so the Italian chef is gonna make eggplant parm and the Italian chef is still able to make pasta all I have to do up here though is just say extend chef and this Italian chef is still gonna be able to make chicken and salad even though I'm not like specifying it inside of here so that's the power of extent that's why extends can be awesome any time that you're reusing or you're using the same methods in multiple classes like we did over here with these different chefs you wanna consider using extends you want to consider extending a class because honestly it's just gonna make your life a lot easier and it's gonna make it a lot easier to manage 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using interface inheritance in Java more specifically we're going to be looking at the implements keyword and how we can use it in our java classes now interface inheritance is a special type of inheritance in Java where we can essentially just define a template for a category of classes called an interface and then we can implement that interface in specific instances so if that definition doesn't make sense right now it will by the end of this video so what I want to do is I want to create an interface just to show you guys exactly what it is and what it's doing and an interface is essentially just a template for a type of class so it's a template for other classes so for example I could create a animal interface and then I could use that interface to create like a cow class or a dog class or a cat class now I'm going to show you guys how we can do something like that in this video but down here in this default package I'm just gonna make a new and I'm gonna make a new interface so usually we would make a new class but this time I'm gonna make a new interface so I'm just gonna click interface and down here we can just give it a name so I'm just gonna call this animal and this is gonna be an interface that we'll use for an animal class so up here you can see that we created this animal Java file and also this public interface animal so essentially what an interface does is it acts as a template for other classes right so a class is basically a way that we can define like a datatype right we can model a real world entity inside of a class but sometimes what you want to do is you'll want to have groups of classes that are related so for example like we'll have classes that all represent different animals right so I could have a class for dog a class for a cat a class for a cow all those classes are animals and a lot of times what you'll want to do is define a template for those classes so we'll want to define something called an interface which will basically specify like hey all animals have this and all animals have that so the cat the dog and the cow all need to have these attributes and that's essentially what an interface does so let me show you how we can create an interface inside of this animal interface I want to define two functions and these are gonna be two things that all animals are gonna have to do or that all animal classes are gonna be able to do so I'm just gonna define some methods so I'm gonna say public speak and I make an open and close parenthesis and then I'm gonna use a semicolon and I'm also gonna say and actually I need to give this a return type so this is gonna be void then I'm gonna say public void eat so I'm giving this animal interface two methods and essentially what I'm saying here is that all animal classes that I create should be able to speak and should be able to eat so all animals speak and eat right that's essentially what we're saying here so now that I define this interface I can actually do what's called implementing this interface so I could create an actual animal class like a dog or a cat or a cow and I could use these methods I could inherit these methods from this interface so let me show you how this works I'm gonna come over here to this default package and I'm gonna make a class so I'm just gonna say class and over here we're just gonna call this dog so we're gonna make a dog class and I'm just gonna click finish so we'll make this dog class now up here this class is representing a dog so this class is modeling a dog in our program and a dog is a type of animal right a dog belongs to like the higher level category of animals so I defined this animal interface and since a dog is an animal I can implement all of the functions of an animal so I can implement all these methods inside of this dog class so what I can say is implements and then the name of the interface so I can say animal once I say implements animal you'll notice over here I'm getting an error on this dog word and down here it says the type must implement the inherited abstract method animal and so there's this little button down here that says add unimplemented methods and if you're using Eclipse you can just click this and what's gonna happen is these two functions are gonna show up so it says public void speak public void eat and we're using these two app override keywords essentially what I'm doing is I'm implementing all of the methods inside of this animal interface into my dog Java class so the animal interface is basically saying like hey all animals should have a method for speaking and a method for eating so if you want to implement the animal interface you have to have these two methods inside of there and you'll notice that these are empty methods so what I could do is I could just come in here and say what happens when the dog speaks so I could say like systems out dot print line and I'll just say woof woof because that's what a dog says right dog barks and then down here when it says eat I can say okay the dog would maybe like eat some kibble so we can say eat some kibble right so I'm basically defining what the dog does when it speaks and what the dog does when it eats now let's say that in addition to a dog I also wanted to create another animal class so I wanted to model another animal inside of my program I can come back over here and we'll make another class and I'm just gonna call this one cow so we'll make a class for a cow and I'll click finish now I can do the same exact thing with this cow so I can say cow implements animal because a cow is a type of animal and I can again add these unimplemented methods so this is just gonna automatically put in public void and speak and public fully eat with these little override keywords and basically this just means that I'm overriding the method and in here we'll say what happens when a cow speaks and this is just gonna be moved that's what cows say and then down here the cow is probably gonna be like eating some grass or something just say eat some grass so we saved this and now I want to make one more animal class so I'm just gonna say new class and now we're gonna make a class for a bird so I'll just say bird and we can just say finish so now we have our bird class and once again I'm gonna implement the animal interface and I'll add in those unimplemented methods so we have this speak method in this eat method so when a bird speaks tweet tweet that's what birds say and then down here we'll just have the bird eating like a worm or something all right so let's go over into our app dot Java class and here I have my main method and I want to show you guys why implementing that animal interface is so useful so if I wanted to I could just create for example like a cow object I could say cow my cow is equal to new cow right I could do this and I'll be able to create a cow and so I could say like my cow eat and the cow is basically just gonna eat so if I say my cow eat it's gonna say eat some grass so we're doing that with the cow I could also do the same thing with a dog so down here I can instead of saying cow I can just say dog and my dog dot so basically I'm creating a dog now and the dog is gonna eat so the cow eats some grass the dog eats some kibble but remember both of these classes are implementing that animal interface so technically according to Java both the cow and the dog are animals so instead of saying cow my cow is equal to new cow I can actually say animal my cow is equal to new cow and I could say animal my dog is equal to new dog because technically the cow is an animal and the dog is an animal so if I say this it's actually gonna work the same way so while the cow and the dog are technically the cow datatype and the dog datatype they're also both the animal datatype and what's cool about this and on show you over here is we can actually create for example like an array of animals and we'll have a cow a dog and we could also have a bird inside of it so I could say animal and I'm going to create an array of animals so I'm just gonna say animal these open the closed square brackets and I'll just say animals and now I can actually set this equal to a bunch of different animals so in here I could say new cow and then down here we could say new dog and down here we could say new bird so inside of this animals array I'm actually able to store three different types of classes I'm able to store a dog alongside a cow alongside a bird right because even though there are different classes they're all technically the same type they're all technically animals and I want to show you what's really cool about this so what I can do is I could actually write a loop that's gonna loop through this animals array and I'm actually able to call the same methods on all of these classes so I'll show you guys I'm gonna say 4 into I is equal to 0 I is less than animals length I plus plus so I'm basically just gonna loop through this array of animals and down here what I want to say is I basically just want to print out animals i dot e right and what I can do is I can run this program and it's gonna say eat some grass eat some kibble eats a worm so I'm able to call this same dot eat method but on three different types of classes so I instead of saying dot eat I could also say like dot speak and now instead of saying what they're eating it's gonna say what they say so I can say like the cow says moo the dog woof-woof the bird tweet sweet but what's cool about this is I'm storing these three different objects these three different types of objects so the cow object the dog object and the bird object all of which are using different classes inside of this same animals array because technically even though they're differ classes they're all the same like high-level data type and this is what's really cool about interfaces so you'll notice down here like all of these three classes have this same dot speak method right we know for a fact that they all have that dot speak method because when we implemented the animal interface it forced us to create them it forced us it said hey you have to create a speak method if you want to be an animal you know it said okay this cow has to have a speak method if it wants to be an animal or this bird has to have a speak method if it wants to be an animal if it wants to be considered the datatype animal and what we can do by forcing all of those classes to have those specific methods is do something like this where we're using three different classes three different types of classes in the same array and using the same dot speak method so that's why interfaces are awesome that's why implementation inheritance is awesome and this is a super powerful way of structuring your classes inside of Java so whenever you have classes that fall into the same category and need to have the same functions consider using an interface 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about access modifiers in Java now access modifiers are basically keywords that we can give to the entities in our Java program so things like variables or objects or classes and it basically controls what other entities inside of our programs can access them and this is a concept that's pretty central to Java and if you really want to be a Java developer you're gonna have to have at least a decent understanding of how these different things work so I'm gonna give you guys an overview of access modifiers we'll talk about what they do what they don't do and when you should use each one so what I'm talking about access modifiers I'm talking about the public private and protected keywords so there's three keywords in Java that we can use with the different entities in our programs and they're public or the main ones are public private and protected so you've probably seen if you've been following along with this course I'm using these keywords all over the place so over here in my just sort of like main class I have public class app public static void main I'm using this public keyword I also have a Java class set up over here it's this song class and basically this is just modeling a song inside of our program it's like my song datatype and we have a title and artist and a length and over here you see these are private so private string title private string artists private in length what does this mean what do all these things mean well here's the thing access modifiers like I said control what other entities in your Java program can access these different things now public is probably the most common maybe not the most common but at least the most basic to understand public basically means that anything can access it so for example I put public class song up here when I'm using this public key word it just means that any other entities so that could be any other classes any other methods inside of my java program can access this class essentially they know that this class exists and they can you know have access to it and so if you don't care who has access to your class or to one of your variables or to one of your methods you can just go ahead and throw that public keyword on it and you should be good to go for example over here on this class constructor it's public song right this constructor is public that means I can access this constructor so basically I can create a song object over here in my app dot Java file you'll see I'm creating a song holiday and it's just holiday by Green Day right because that constructor is public I'm able to call it I'm able to create a new song if I was to come over here though and change this from public to private all of a sudden now I'm not gonna have access to this constructor so you'll see we're getting an error it says the constructor is not visible now this brings me to our next thing which is private private basically means that this entity so in our case this constructor is only accessible from inside of this class so if I put the private keyword on here only things inside of this class can access it so let's change this back to public and you'll see now I'm able to create a song again because the constructor is public let's take another example so over here I have these attributes set to private so it's private string title if I was to try to access this attribute directly from outside of this class so for example outside here inside of my holiday object if I was trying to say print it out so let's say I was trying to print out the title of this song I can't access it directly so I can't say holiday dot title I'm gonna get an error over here and that's because the title attribute is set to private so I'm not allowed to actually access it if I was to come over here and change this to public now I'll be able to access it all day you can see here we're not getting an error anymore and I could actually print it out onto the screen so you see we're accessing this title directly and we can use public and private to control access so a lot of times what people will do is they'll set all of these attributes equal to private and then they'll let people access these attributes using getters and setters so down here I have these getters and setters for example I have this get title method this is set to public right so I can call this get title method from over here I can say get title that's public right and what the get title method does is it basically just returns the actual title and this works because the song class anything in the song class has access to this title attribute even though it's private even though title is private anything inside of the same class can access it so this get title method works really well because another java program that's outside of this class can call this and then we can just return the title to them so it controls the access to that variable so that's kind of like why getters and setters work so just a review private means only other Java inside of that class can access it so we have a private attribute a private method a private whatever only other things inside of that same class have access to it if I have something that's public that means that any other Java code has access to it there's actually a third type there's a third modifier which is called protected and protected is probably not something you're going to be using too much as a beginner protected it really comes in handy when you have large amounts of Java code and protected essentially allows your java attribute your java class whatever to be accessed only by other Java programs classes etc inside the same package now a package in Java you know essentially is just a folder where we're storing all of the Java files that we want to keep together so a lot of times if you have a big Java project you're gonna store similar Java files so like Java files Java classes whatever that are doing similar things inside of the same package and not again that's when you have like a lot of files and you really need to organize stuff the protected keyword will only allow other Java attributes Java entities inside of that same package to access it so as you get more and more advanced with Java and you start making bigger and bigger programs that protected keyword can come in handy because it'll only allow other Java classes Java methods Java anything inside of that same package to access that attribute whatever so that's one of the three main types public private and protected and really the best way to wrap your head around these things is just to go around and play around with them you know play around with setting different things for public setting different things to private setting different things to protected see how they work but hopefully that clears some stuff up at least now you have a basic understanding of what that public and that private key word and then obviously that protected keyword as well or actually doing and what they mean 



in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about creating methods inside of the same class that we have our main method so you've been following along with this course there's probably been one question that you've had or if you haven't had it then I'm gonna address it in this video anyway over here I have my main method right I just have this main method public static void main remember this method is important in Java because any code we put in here is gonna get executed when we run our program you'll notice though down here below this main method I've created another method and this method is called say hi and you pass it a string and it just says hi so this is like the simplest method in the world but you'll notice here I'm using this static keyword and if you've been following along up to this point you'll know that generally when we create methods like if I create a method inside of a class I don't always have to use this static keyword now we can use this static keyword and we've talked about you know what the static keyword does when you're using it inside of a class the question becomes why are we using this static keyword up here with this main method and the basic answer is because when we have this main method set to static which absolutely has to be we can only call this say high method if we also make it static otherwise I can't so if I was to get rid of this static keyword down here if I just said public void like we normally would see over here we get this error message it says cannot make a static reference to a non-static method say hi basically what that means is if this guy isn't static then this static method can't access it and you know I could get into the you know the technical reasons why this is happening but basically I just want to point out that this is the thing so if I want to be able to call it just like this I have to make this static down here the question becomes what happens if we don't want to make this static so is it possible for me to get rid of this static keyword and still be able to use this method and the simple answer is absolutely the only thing we're gonna have to create an instance we're gonna have to create an object of the app class so you'll notice in here my public static void main method is contained inside of this app class right and even though the main method is like super special I can still use this as a normal object so if I wanted to use this say hi function all I have to do is create an app object so I can just say app my app is equal to new app so now I'm creating an app object and I can just reference this method directly so I can say my app dot say hi and now I should be able to access this say hi method just like we did before the only difference was I had to create an instance of the app class and so that's kind of the main difference between you know using this guy down here as static and not using it as static so as we went through this course especially when I like introduced methods I was just kind of like hey you just need to trust me that we need to put static down here that was basically just for a simplicity sake but now that we have an understanding of not only objects and classes but also static I wanted to show you guys you know essentially why this is the case so that's basically all you need to do to create a method down here that's not static 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about packages and imports in Java so a Java package is essentially just a like a folder or a container where we can store Java files that are similar and you know that's sort of like the general definition but really you can use packages to just store different files organize different Java files inside of your java project so over here you'll see I have my Java project which is just draft and I have this source folder and inside of this source folder I have this default package and this is just a package that was created by eclipse when I created my app dot Java file so Eclipse basically just forced me to put this file inside of this default package like I said a packages you know for all intents and purposes just a folder where we can store Java files and packages have special attributes so you know if files are in the same package and then they can do certain things it files that are in the same packages have like a better relationship I guess you could say then files and art in the same packages so I just want to talk about like that and talk about using files that are in different packages and stuff like that so first thing we'll talk about how to create a package so in eclipse it's really easy I can just right click on this source folder click new and I can click package so down here I can just name this package so why don't we just say p1 so I'm just gonna call this like package 1 and I'm gonna click the finish button down here so now we have this new package so if I want I can create a file in here so I'm gonna create a Java class and we're just gonna call this my class so this is just gonna be a very like general class I'm not really talking too much about classes so now I'll click finish and you can see here I have this public class my class and Java by default put this package p1 thing up there for us now it basically just says like you know what package that this thing is in so if I wanted to use this my class class inside of this app dot Java file I'm actually gonna have to do something called importing it so because this class is in p1 package if I want to use it over here like if I wanted to create an instance of this my class class I can't just do it like I normally would so I can't just say my class my class is equal to new my class you'll notice that I'm getting an error over here so this is actually has this red underline and it says my class cannot be resolved to a type in order to use this class because it's in a different package than this app classes in I have to import it basically I have to tell Java where this class is because Java doesn't know where it is it's not inside of our current package and so Java is like I have no idea where this class is so what we can do is we can come up here and you want to do this before you put this public class line I can just say import and now I want to specify the package that I want to import this from so I can just say p1 and I want to say dot and I want to say the name of the class that I want to import so I can say my class and we need to send me : after this so this tells Java where my classes and tells Java that I want to use the my class that's inside of package 1 so down here I can say my class class and I'm able to create this class down here without getting an error and the reason this is useful is because you know for example let's say I had another package so let's create another package in the source folder and I'm just gonna call it p2 so down here we'll just say p2 and we can create it and inside of this p2 package let's say I had another class and maybe this class is also called my class so these two classes in these two different packages have the same name well if I was to come over here in my app dot Java file I'm using my class from the package p1 but if I wanted I could change this and I could say my class from the p2 package and now I'll be using a completely different class from a completely different pack and that's kind of how packages can come in handy you can have like different groups of classes maybe some of them even have the same name and you can specify which one you want to import and which one you want to use inside of other classes and other packages in your Java program so packages are extremely useful and you know really they're not that complicated to use just take code put it inside of a package and you have other code and you want to organize it put it into a different package but if you want to use code that's in a different package you have to always import it and you always want to specify what package you want to import it from and also one more thing whenever you create a class inside of a given package you need to define this up here so you see up there we say p1 over here we say p2 if I got rid of this line then I'm gonna get an error so you can see there's an error over here and the reason we didn't have to use that inside of this class I didn't have to say like package whatever is because this is just the default class or the default package so hopefully that explains a little bit about what imports are and a little bit about what packages are throughout this course you might have seen me importing different things and that's basically what I'm doing here I'm just importing classes that are inside different packages that I want to use inside of my program
