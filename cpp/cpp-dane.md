# C++

In this course I'm gonna be teaching you everything you need to know to get started writing C++ a C++ is one of the most popular programming languages around and for good reason it's an awesome programming language it's actually a language that is closely related to the C programming language in fact C++ is essentially just like the next level of the C programming language so if you're already familiar with the C programming language then you're gonna have no problem picking up C++ but even if you're not C++ is a great first programming language to learn and in this course I'm gonna teach you guys all of the core concepts for C++ we're gonna start off just with the basics we're gonna you know get everything set up we'll install C++ we'll get you guys set up with the text editor and I'll show you guys how to write your first program then we're gonna get a little bit more advanced so we'll start looking at things like variables and we'll work with data will even write a couple different programs and some little games and then we're really gonna get into the thick of it we're gonna learn all sorts of different programming structures things like loops and if statements and classes and objects it's gonna be awesome we're gonna cover all of the core concepts not just in C++ but all the core concepts for programming in general so the knowledge you learn in this course will actually be able to carry over to potentially other programming languages as well I'm really excited to be able to bring you guys tutorials on C++ it's an awesome language is super fun to develop in and it's a good first language to learn if you're just getting into programming so stick around for this course you can kind of work through the videos at your own pace and hopefully you guys can learn something about this awesome language C++.

In this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to get everything set up to start working with C++ so in order to start working with C++ and start writing programs and doing all that fun stuff we actually have to do a little bit of setup we're actually gonna need two things on our computer the first thing we're gonna need is a text editor and we're basically just gonna use this text editor in order to write our C++ programs any text editor is gonna work generally you don't want to use a text editor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs you're gonna want to use just like a basic text editor it could be something like notepad I'm gonna show you guys a special text editor called an IDE which stands for integrated development environment and we can use that text editor it's basically just an environment that's really awesome for writing C++ code and then we're also gonna need an addition to a text editor we're gonna need a program called a compiler specifically a C++ compiler and this is a program that'll basically take the C++ code that we write and it will translate it or transform it into a language that the computer is going to be able to understand so as long as we have a text editor and we have our C++ compiler then we're ready to start programming in C++ so I'm gonna show you guys how to get all that set up first thing we're gonna do is head over to our browser and I'm over here on this website called code blocks it's just WWE code blocks org and code blocks is what's called an IDE so it's an integrated development environment it's essentially just a special environment special text editor that can be used to write C++ code so this is gonna be exactly what we need I'm just gonna click downloads over here and you'll see there's a few options one says download the binary release download the source code we're gonna click download the binary release and this is gonna bring us to this page you can see there's a link over here for Windows XP Vista 7 8 etc there's also links for Linux and Mac let's click on this windows option and over here you'll see there's a bunch of these different options so what we're gonna do is we're gonna download this one over here that says code blocks 1601 min GW setup and actually what's cool about this is it's going to include not only the code blocks text editor but this is also going to include that C++ compiler that I was talking about so we can download both of those things in this one download for code block so this is the easiest way to do this as a beginner so let's go ahead and download this I'm just gonna come over here and click on this link for SourceForge and this should start downloading the file onto our computer when code box is finished downloading let's go ahead and open that up so I'm just gonna head over to my downloads folder and we can open that guy up you can see over here it says code blocks 1601 mi ng W setup let's open this and this should open up into an installer window so let's click through this installer window and we can just select all the default options and they should start installing the code blocks on our computer so once code blocks is finished downloading then we have everything we need on our computer to start writing in C++ and you can see over here I just opened up code blocks and the next tutorial we're going to talk about how to set up your first code blocks project and get started writing C++.

In this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to get your first C++ project up and running in code blocks so over here I just opened up code blocks and this is sort of like the welcome screen that we get when we first open it you see over here there's a couple options one says create new project and that's actually what we're gonna do so before we're gonna start writing our C++ I'm just gonna show you guys how to get a C++ project up and running and ready to go in code blocks so let's click create new project and this should open up this little window over here so you'll see there's all these different options and these are essentially just different types of C++ applications that we can create we're gonna just do the bare basics so you want to come over here and click console application and then just click go and we're just gonna click Next and over here you'll see we can select between a couple different languages we want to click C++ so I'm gonna click Next and we're just gonna give this project a title so I'm just gonna call it draft when you'll see down here I'm storing it inside of my desktop if you want to change it you can come over here and you can put it whatever you want let's click Next and you'll see over here we just have a bunch of options you can just leave these as the default and we're gonna click finish once we click finish then our C++ project should have been created so over here in our little tree viewer you'll see that we have our C++ projects and down here inside of this sources folder we have this file main dot CPP and CPP is a file extension that stands for c++ so I'm just gonna right click this and I'm just gonna open it and you'll see over here we have a bunch of code that's already been included in this file so this is essentially just like the most basic C++ file that you can write I mean this is what we call like a HelloWorld program so you'll see down here it's just printing out HelloWorld onto the screen and don't really worry too much about what this stuff up here is really let's just focus on this line down here this line is actually going to print something out for us so if I was to come over here and I'm actually gonna come up here in my editor and I'm gonna click on this build and run option so when I click this a window should pop up and it should basically just say like hello world you'll see down here this little black window popped up and it says hello world so let's just go over some basic terminology generally whenever we're going to run a program in C++ we're going to build the program and then we're gonna run the program building the program basically means that we're taking all this code over here and we're converting it down into a language that the computer can understand so the first thing we always have to do is build the file then what we want to do is run the file which basically means we're telling our computer to execute all of the instructions that we wrote in our program and there's a bunch of different ways we can do that here in code blocks you can click this little cog wheel up here and that'll build your program and then you can click this play button over here that's gonna run your program but a lot of times if you just wrote some new code and you want to test it out you can just click this build and run option and for the most part in this course we're always just gonna be whenever I say we're running the program I'm just gonna click this button and we'll build it and run it at the same time so like I said this is a very basic C++ file in the next tutorial we're gonna talk about like what all this stuff is we're gonna look at writing some of our own instructions maybe modifying these instructions and we'll kind of dive a little bit deeper into you know just sort of the bare basics but for now we have everything set up so we have our C++ project set up we have our first C++ file called main dot CPP and we're ready to start programming.

In this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about the basics of writing a C++ program we're just going to talk generally about what programs are and how we can write them and we're gonna write a little program which is gonna print out a shape onto the screen so this is gonna be pretty fun but down here I just have this basic program and when I first created my C++ project in the last tutorial we sort of got this basic program and this was kind of given to us and this is you know essentially just a very simple C++ program so I'm gonna walk you guys through essentially what we have here we're gonna talk about a couple of different things and then we'll start writing some code so up here we have these two lines of code this is like hash tag include iostream and this one says using name scape STD essentially what this does is it's kind of like configuration options for our C++ file as a beginner like you know don't really worry too much about what this stuff is or what it's doing we're gonna talk more about all this stuff later in the course but for now just know that you need to have it there in order for us to write our programs down here we have this line it says int main and there's an open and close parenthesis this is actually what's called a function in C++ okay and don't worry too much about what a function is I'm just kind of throwing out these words so you kind of familiar with hearing them but essentially what this is is it's a container for us to put the code inside of our C++ programs so this function called main is a very special function because any lines of code that we put inside of here in other words any lines of code that we put in between these open and closed curly brackets is actually gonna get executed when we run our program so down here I just have this thing it says return zero and again don't worry too much about what this is just know that you need to have this in this main function over here though we have an actual line of code so this says C out and then it says hello world then it says end L and this is a basic line of code in our program so again any lines of code that we put in between these curly brackets for this main function is gonna get executed with our program so if I was to come up here and run my program and I'm just gonna click this build and run option right here you'll see when the program runs it prints out hello world and you'll see this little window that opened up here this is what we would call the console and the console is basically just a little window that will output information so whenever we run our C++ code this console window is gonna open up and sometimes we can tell C++ that we want to print things out onto this console window so if you ever hear me referring to the console I'm just referring to this window right here now let's get down and start talking about programming so again any of the code inside this main function is gonna get executed and here we just have one line of code so what I can actually do is I could copy this and down below here I can say something else so I could say just like my name Mike and now when I run this program you'll see it's gonna print out both of these things so here on the first line it prints out hello world and then over here on the second line it prints out Mike and this is just sort of like basically how we could print something out to the console you'll see over here it says C out and that stands for console out and then over here you'll see we have this little line it says end L and this stands for end line and basically what this means is we're ending the line where we're going to print out text so you'll notice that we printed out hello world and then on the next line we printed out Mike so using these little print statements I'm actually going to show you guys how we can write a little program that's gonna draw a shape out onto the screen so I'm actually gonna go ahead and get rid of this text and I'm just gonna copy this guy here a couple times so we'll make like four of these and I'm gonna print out a triangle onto the screen so I'm just gonna print a forward slash and then we'll do a space and a forward slash and I'm just gonna keep doing this and you'll see we're kind of drawing this little diagonal shape upwards now I'm gonna use vertical bars and we're gonna go all the way down so I'm just gonna keep going like this and down here why don't we put some underscores and then with the last vertical bar you'll see over here I'm actually writing out a bunch of instructions and each of these instructions is telling C++ then we want to print out a different line onto the console so now when I run my program you'll see we're actually printing out this little triangle so this is a very basic program but you'll see just by using those four simple instructions we were able to actually draw something out onto the screen so let's talk about this essentially what's happening when we click that Run button is C++ is going and it's looking inside of our program and the first thing it's gonna do is it's gonna look for this main function right here so it's gonna look for this block of code and that's basically just what a function is it's gonna look for this block of code called main and inside of these open and close curly brackets it's gonna execute all of the instructions inside of there and basically when we're writing a program all we're doing is we're just telling the computer a bunch of instruction so we're giving the computer a bunch of instructions that we want it to carry out so imagine that for example in real life like you were using a recipe or something a recipe is a lot like a program a recipe has a list of instructions and if you follow those instructions correctly then you end up with like something delicious that's basically what a program is program is just a collection of instructions that we're giving to the computer and we can give the computer simple instructions like this and we can do something simple like a draw out of shape but as we go through this course and we learn more and more complex instructions and we learn how to use them together in unison with each other we're gonna be able to tell the computer to do a bunch of complex things so the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is the order that these instructions get executed so just like if you were following a recipe and you would start with the first instruction and you'd go down to the last instruction the computer is going to execute these instructions in order so it's going to start with this instruction and basically here we're just telling the computer over telling C++ that we want to print this line of text out onto the stream so C++ is gonna do this and then once it's done with that it's going to move on to this instruction it's going to this out to the secod onto the screen et cetera it's gonna keep doing that so actually let me show you guys if I was to get rid of this line and I was to put it up here now you'll see when we run our program that we're gonna print out a funky looking shape so instead of this base being down at the bottom here we're gonna print it out on the top and that's because we changed the order of the instructions so again all a program is is it's just a set of instructions that we give to the computer that's it it's very simple the more complex instructions that we can give the computer and the more ways that we're able to combine those instructions in different ways the more complex our programs are going to be so as we go through this course I'm gonna be teaching you guys all sorts of more complex instructions we're gonna learn different ways to do different things and we'll use real-world examples to build little applications and you'll end up learning a bunch along the way.

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about using variables in C++ now a lot of times when we're writing programs in C++ we're gonna be dealing with all different types of data and information and a lot of times when we're dealing with that data and information it can be kind of hard to keep track of and a variable is basically just a container where we can store different pieces of information or different data values in our programs and it makes it a lot easier for us to manage and maintain and use that data so I'm gonna show you guys an example and we'll I'll show you guys basically how variables are useful and how we can use them in C++ so down here I have a very basic program that I've written out you'll see down here I'm basically just printing out a bunch of lines of text it says there once was a ma named George he was 70 years old he liked the name George but did not like being 70 so this is basically like my little story here and you'll see I can run my program and this is a valid program in C++ it basically just prints out the story and we have all of our information so you know this is a pretty nice C++ program it serves its purposes but let's say that I'm looking at my story and I'm thinking hmm maybe I want to change the characters name right maybe I don't like the name George maybe I want to change it to a different name so what I could do is I could go through and I can manually change it in each line of code so I could come here where it says George and I could change it let's say we want to change the character's name to John alright so I can change it to John I'll keep looking through the story down here it also says George so I'll change it to John and there we go we've changed the character's name we've officially updated it let's say maybe now I'm thinking to myself I think I want to make the character a little bit younger instead of 70 why don't we make John 35 so I can do the same thing I can go in and manually change the value of 70 to 35 so we can come over here and we could say he was 70 what changes to 35 and we'll say did not like being 17 okay so we'll change that to 35 as well so now we've officially updated our story we've changed the character's name and we've chained the characters age here's the problem though in order to make those changes I had to manually go through and individually edit each one of the places where the character's name showed up or the character's age showed up and imagine that instead of having a story that was only four lines long I had a story that was like hundreds of lines we mentioned the character's name hundreds of times and we mentioned their age hundreds of times well all of a sudden it becomes a lot more difficult for me to manage those pieces of information so it's difficult for me to manage the character's name and the character's age right if I had a story that was hundreds of lines long and we mentioned the character's name 100 times having to you know go and modify and update that name would be a very tedious task because I'd have to go through and essentially just do it manually this is where something like variables come in a lot of times in our programs we're gonna have different pieces of information different data values that we want to keep track of and we want to be able to manage so what we can do is we can take those pieces of information and we can put them inside of containers called variables and a variable like I said it's just a container where we can store a piece of data and it'll make it a lot easier for us to use and manage that piece of data in our programs so I'm gonna show you guys how we could create a variable that can store the character's name and the character's age and you'll see why this can be useful in something like this so over here I'm gonna create a couple variables when we create a variable in C++ we actually have to tell C++ a couple of things the first thing we have to tell C++ is what type of information we want to store inside of the variable now in the next video I'm gonna talk to you guys all about the different types of data that we can use in C++ but for now I'm just gonna show you guys two types of data the first type of data that we can store inside of a variable is called a string and that basically means it's a string of character so it's like plain text so this down here where it's saying there once was a man named John this is a string right it's plain text in our program a lot of times we're going to be dealing with strings so I'm gonna create a string variable in other words I'm going to create a container that can store a string value so I'm just gonna say string and that's the first thing that we have to tell C++ the next thing we have to do is give this container give this variable a name so what we want to do is give this a descriptive name which will basically tell us what is inside of the variable so I'm just gonna call this character name just like that and what I can do now is I can give this a value so I could say character name is equal to and now we can type in the character's name so I could say John just like that alright so once we've created this character name value variable now this value John this string value is now stored inside of this character named variable the next thing we're gonna do is create another variable to store the characters age in addition to storing data in the form of a string we can also store numbers now age is a whole number so what I can do is I can store it inside of something called an integer and an integer is basically just a whole number so I could just say int and I can just call this character age now I want to show you guys another thing that we can do so up here what we did is we said string character name and we set it equal to a value right away but what I could also do is put a semicolon here and also I do want to point out whenever we're writing lines of code in C++ every time you finish writing a line of code you want to put in this semicolon I'm not sure if I mentioned that in the last video but the semicolon basically tells C++ that we're done with that line of code so this separates one line of code from another so you need always make sure you put these semicolons but with the variable what I could do is I could say int character name I could do the same thing for string and then I could go on to a new line and I could give this a value so I could say like character age is equal to and now I'm just gonna type in a number so we said that John was going to be equal to 35 and you'll notice when we use numbers we don't have to surround these with quotation marks we just can type out the number so now we have two variables and I showed you two different ways that we can create them and what we can do is we can use these Abel's inside of our story and you'll see how this makes it a lot easier for us to maintain this program so what we want to do is we want to replace every instance of the character's name and the character's age with the variable so instead of just printing out John here I want to refer to this variable and the way that we need to do that is we basically need to include this variable so over here I'm printing out this string of text I'm printing out a bunch of plain text right but let's say instead of just printing out John here as plain text I want to instead print out the value that was stored inside of the character name variable what I can do is I can just get rid of John and I can say lesson sign less than sign and what this is basically going to tell C++ is that we want to take the value that we're gonna type out here so I'm just gonna type out character name and it's basically telling C++ that we want to take this value and we want to insert it right here inside of this line of text so when I go ahead and run my program now you'll see that we're still printing out there once was a man named John except now I didn't actually type out John all I did was include this variable right here and I basically just said that we want to put the variable right in there so that's how we can include a variable inside of one of these print statements so over here I'm gonna do the same thing so I'm just gonna say less and less then character name and now this is going to insert the character name in other words it's going to insert the value stored inside of the character name variable at this position we can do the same for the age so over here we have the character's age I'm gonna get rid of that and I'm gonna say less than less than and now character age and so the value inside the character age variable is going to get placed right in there and we have one more place where we have the character's age so over here I'm gonna get rid of this and now this is going to be special so you'll see over here we want to insert the value inside of the character age variable right in between this text so I'm gonna put it right here what I can do is I can make two quotation marks and essentially what this is doing is it's saying this is going to be its own string of text and this is going to be its own string of text and I can make two less than signs I can type out the character age variable and then I'm gonna make two more less than signs and this is essentially just gonna string all of these together so it's gonna say print out this text then print out the value inside of the character age variable then print out this text so I've now replaced every instance of the characters age and every instance of the characters name with those variables let's run our program and see what happens over here you'll see we have the same exact story as we did before there once is a man named John he was 35 years old John 35 so without having to manually do anything we were able to include those values and now what's cool about variables is if I wanted to update the character's name or update the character's age all I have to do is change it up here in one spot so if I wanted to change the character's name to Tom and I wanted to make Tom let's say 50 years old I only have to modify the values that are getting stored in the variables and they'll automatically update down in our story so now when I run my program you'll see it's using the name Tom and it's saying that he's 50 years old so that's kind of an awesome way that we can use these variables another cool thing that these variables allow us to do is modify the value so let's say that halfway through our story I wanted to change the character's name and so halfway through I wanted to make the name be a different name all I have to do is say character name and I can actually assign this a different value so I could give this the value of Mike and again I'm gonna need a semicolon here at the end of this line of code and now you'll see halfway through the story the character's name is gonna change so it says there once was a man named Tom and down here it's using the name Mike so not onl was I able to just use those variables to insert these values but I can actually modify those very at different places in my program so that's pretty awesome now this is just sort of like the bare basics of variables variables are containers they allow us to maintain and keep track of the data and the values and our programs a lot better and they also give us the advantage of only having to assign a value once so I can assign a value once up here and then I can use it and refer to it in different places down here I can also modify those values at different places in my programs so in this tutorial we talked about storing values as strings of text and as integers which are whole numbers in the next tutorial I'm gonna show you guys all of the different types of information and the different types of variables that we can create in our programs

In this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about the different data types in C++ a datatype basically just means a type of data or a type of information that we can use and work with inside of our C++ programs so there's all different types of information we can store like texts different types of numbers decimal numbers true/false values all sorts of stuff and I'm gonna kind of walk you guys through what all of those are and how we can use them so the easiest way for me to demonstrate this is just gonna be to create a bunch of different variables so any of the different types of data that we can work with in C++ we can actually store inside of variables so I'm just gonna create a couple different variables and I'll kind of show you guys exactly how this is gonna work so the first data type I want to talk to you guys about is called a character and a character basically allows us to represent one single character so the way we can create a character variable is just by saying CH AR and now I want to give this a name so let's just call it like great or something and whenever we create a character we're gonna use these single quotation marks so I can store any like regular character that I would want inside of here so you know essentially any character that you can think of you could store in here and then we're gonna include this semicolon so that's basically like the character data type and in addition to just storing one single character there's gonna be a lot of situations where we're gonna want to store a lot more than one and what we can actually do is use something called a string and a string is basically just a string of characters so it's instead of just being one single character it's like a bunch of different characters so this would be like essentially just plain text that we would see in a program so I could just say string and we could just call this like phrase and when I create a string I can use these double quotation marks so I could say like giraffe Academy or something and now we're gonna be able to store instead of just one character a bunch of different characters so there's different situations where you might want to use either like a char or a string but for the most part I think strings are probably a little bit more common use them chars so instead of just plain text we can also store and work with numbers so essentially there's two different types of numbers or two basic types of numbers there's whole numbers and then there's decimal numbers some people will also call those floating-point numbers a whole number is like a counting number so think like 1 2 3 4 5 right there just whole number of solid numbers there's no decimal points right then we have decimal numbers so it would be like 0.5 or 1 point 2 6 7 or 10 point 11 you know basically a number that has a decimal point after it when we work with these different numbers C++ is actually going to distinguish between them so the first type of number we can work with is an integer so I could just say int and this could be like an age or something so whenever we were creating a number we can just type out the numbers so I could say like 50 and you'll notice I don't need any quotation marks I don't need anything special surrounding this I can just type out the number in addition to positive numbers you can also use negative numbers but anytime we're using an integer you can't have a decimal point so you can't do anything with decimals these are just gonna be solid whole numbers if you want to work with a decimal you have two basic options so there's two data types that represent decimals in our programs the first is called float and this basically just stands for like floating point number the second one is called double now you'll hear different people talk about these different data types the main difference is just how many decimal points they can store so a double can store more decimal points than a float so if you need a number to be very specific as far as like how many decimal points you can take it to then you definitely want to use a double and I would say it for the most part as a beginner just only worry about doubles floats will be used more in specific circumstances but you know as you're just learning this language really just worry about doubles so we could just say double like GPA and I could set this equal to like 4.5 or like 2.3 basically I can make this any decimal number that and keep in mind you could also do like 2.0 so it doesn't have to be like a different number decimal and again you can make these negative that's no problem so ants are gonna be what we're going to use for whole numbers for the most part doubles are gonna be what we're gonna use for decimal numbers so that covers text and numbers and just with those two datatypes with texts we can use characters and strings and an instant doubles you can represent like just about any type of information in your programs but c++ is awesome so they're actually gonna give us another data type which is called a boolean and a boolean is maybe not as intuitive as like text and numbers a boolean is actually what we would call a true/false value so when we're writing our programs there's actually give me a lot of situations in circumstances where we want to represent true or false data and a boolean is just a special word for true or false right so I could say B ool that stands for boolean and we could create a variable like Ismail right so this variable Ismail is gonna store a true or a false value inside of it and this will basically tell us whether or not someone is male so in my case I could say true because I am a male right so you'll see how this can kind of come in handy for different things like we could say something is true or we could say something is false and that allows us to represent a certain type of information I could also say false over here and that's gonna be the opposite so these are gonna come in handy a lot these true/false values and we can use boolean z' to represent them so for the most part these are the basic datatypes now there's a couple other data types that we could also get into but I think 99% of the time as a beginner as somebody who's learning C++ you know don't concern yourself with anything that you don't have to so boolean's doubles which are just decimal numbers and switch are whole numbers strings which is plain text and chars which are just single characters that's what we're gonna be working with so as we go forward in the course we're gonna be working with all this different type of information now I want to point out one more things I'm actually just gonna make a little print statement here and you know this is a basic statement so if I wanted to I could print out any one of these variables like if I could print out grade for example and this is gonna go ahead and print that out onto the screen you see over here we're just printing out a but we don't have to store this information inside a variable so if I wanted I could just type in a string down here right I don't have to store it in a variable and this is what we would call a constant so I don't need to store it inside of a variable I could also you know type out like false or I can type out a number like 4.5 or I could type out an integer or I could type out a character like you don't have to put these things inside of variables a lot of times you can just use them like straight-up like that and this is what we would call a constant but a lot of times you're gonna want to store information and variables because it's really useful and obviously when you do that you have to declare the datatype and you have to tell C++ what type of data you want to work with

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about the ins and outs of working with strings in C++ now in the C++ programming language one of the most common types of data that you're gonna be working with are gonna be strings and strings are basically just plain text so any type of plain text we're gonna represent or work with in our program is gonna be considered a string so down here you'll have to see how this little program set up basically just printing on a couple lines so the waggon created string is just by using an open and closed quotation marks like this so I can basically type out whatever I want I wanted so I could type out giraffe Academy you'll see now I'm printing out giraffe Academy and hello if I was to run my program you'll see that we print a draft Academy and hello first thing I want to show you guys is doing has to do with this C out line of code over here so you'll notice here it says end L right here and basically when we put end L right there it tells C++ that we want to print a new line after we print whatever is in here so if I was to get rid of this and I just said C out graphic adam ii now what you'll see is that hello is gonna get printed on the same line as giraffe Academy because we didn't put end L so we didn't put a new line if I wanted to though I could actually manually come in here and specify a new line by saying a backslash n so backslash n basically means that we want to print out a new line so this inside of a string represents the newline character so now when I run this program you'll see that Hello gets printed out on a new line so that's how we can use that backslash and inside of our string in order to do essentially the same thing as and L is doing and if I wanted I could put this like in between these two words and it would put them on a new line so in addition to just printing out a string like we did over here I could also store a string inside of a variable so in order to create a string variable I can just say string will give it a name so we can just call this phrase and I could set it equal to whatever I want so let's set it equal to traffic Adam E and then I can do exactly what I did down here so here I could just print out phrase and now it'll be printing out traffic Adam II onto the screen just like that so in addition to just printing out strings and kind of working with them that way storing them inside at variables we can also use what's called string functions now a function is something that we're gonna get into more later in the course we're gonna write our own functions but for now just know that a function is basically like a little block of code that we can call which will perform a specific task for us so these functions do all sorts of things and there's a lot of functions that we can use with these strings and they're called string functions so these functions will either like modify the string or they'll give us information about the string so I'm gonna show you guys a couple so the first string function that I want to show you guys is the length function and all I have to do to use this is I can just come down here and I'm actually just gonna print out the result of using these functions so I'm gonna put it down here I get to say phrase dot length and I can make an open and close parenthesis and generally when we're calling a function and C we're gonna use this dot and then we're gonna type the name of the function so this is the length function then we're going to make an open and close parenthesis like that so now if I was to run this program you'll see we're getting 15 so this is basically just telling us how many characters are inside of this phrase string so how many characters are inside RAF Academy now if I wanted to I could actually access individual characters inside of here so let's say that I wanted to access just this G so I wanted to print out the first character in this string well I can make an open and closed square brackets just like this and inside of here I can put a zero and zero is gonna refer to this first character in the string so now when I run my program you'll see we're just printing out this capital G if I want to access this R for example I could say two and two is our going to refer to this R so now when I run my program we're printing out R as you can see over here so if you haven't caught on yet whenever we're indexing a string we're starting at zero so if I was to assign index positions to each one of these characters in the string I would say that G is an index position zero III is it index position one R is an index position to a 3 F 4 etc so whenever C++ is indexing a string it always starts indexing it at 0 so it'll start counting basically 0 1 2 3 4 even though G is the first character in traffic Adam II it's technically at index position 0 so whenever we're using something like this we're referring to like a specific character we want to refer to the index position which is gonna start at 0 another thing I could do is I could actually like modify a specific character in a string so I could say like phrase and I can refer to an individual character inside of this string so we could say like phrase 0 I could assign this a new value so I can assign this the value of a new character so you'll notice I'm using these single quotes so I could say like B and so now instead of saying gee I are a FF II it's gonna say BIR a FF II because I'm essentially changing one of the characters in this string so now when we print this out you'll see it says Burapha Kadim e instead of giraffe Academy so that can be kind of handy just to modify a specific character inside of a string we could also find out information about this string so I showed you guys how we can find out the link in the string but imagine if we wanted to find out whether or not a specific string or a specific character was inside of this string I could say phrase dot find and I can make an open and close parenthesis and actually inside of these open and close parentheses I'm going to give this find function a couple of different pieces of information so I'm going to give it some information for it to perform its task with and these are called parameters so anytime I give a function different pieces of information we call it passing parameters or you'll also hear people will call them arguments so passing arguments or passing parameters basically it's just information that we give to this function so this fine function I need to give a couple pieces of information the first thing I can do is give it a string or a character that I want it to find so let's say I want it to find Academy so basically I want to check to see if the word Academy is inside of this phrase string of here the next argument I want to give this an expert is gonna be an integer and it's going to be the index where I want to start looking so if I wanted to just check to see if it was in the string I could say zero if I wanted to check to see if acad occurred after the third index then I could say three let's just say zero so now this is actually going to give us back a number and it'll tell me at what index position inside of this string acad occurs so now I'm gonna run my program you'll see over here it's giving us an eight back that's because Academy starts at index position zero one two three four five six seven eight so Academy starts at index position eight and that's why it gave that back to us so I could do this with anything I could say like ffv or something and now this will tell me where FF e starts inside of this string so it starts at index position four so I can be pretty useful and it's a really useful way to find to figure out of different things or different strings show up in the string you're working with there's one more string function that I want to show you guys which is called substring so it's just phrased SUV STR and this is also gonna take two parameters so we're gonna give this two pieces of information the first piece of information we're gonna give this is a starting index now substring allows us to take you know just part of this string so I could specify that I want to take like all the characters after this a or I can specify that I wanted to take like from index position zero index position one all the way to the end basically it'll allow me to take like just a subsection of this string so the first parameter I want to give this is a starting index so I could say like 8 and so basically this is gonna start grabbing a new string at index position eight then I can give this a link and this is basically gonna tell substring how many characters I want to grab so if I said like three this is basically gonna start at index position eight so it's gonna start up here at this a and it's gonna grab three characters so it's gonna grab this a this C and this a so now when I print this out you'll see we get a CA just like that and that's basically what we do so this is the starting index and this is the link and one of the cool things we could do is we could actually take this and store this substring in another string so I could say like string phrase sub just like that and then I can come down here and I could say phrase sub is equal to and then what we just had before so phrase dot substring and now if we print it out phrase sub it'll print out ACA so I'm essentially storing the value of the substring in another string so that can be pretty useful and that's really the basics of working with strings I mean obviously there's certain things that I left out you know I could spend an hour just talking about all the different things we could do with strings but I think that kind of covers the basics kind of shows you all the basic things that you can do we looked at some basic functions we talked about grabbing individual characters we talked about string indexes so I think for now that should be a good introduction into working with strings in C++.

in this tutorial, I'm gonna talk to you guys about working with numbers in C++ now whenever you're writing programs in C++ one of the most common types of data that you're gonna be dealing with are gonna be numbers so these could be things like whole numbers or decimal numbers basically I'm gonna give you guys a full overview of how to work with numbers we'll talk about the basics we'll look at how we can use different mathematical functions in order to do different mathematical operations with our numbers so this is gonna be a pretty cool tutorial now down here I'm just gonna talk to you guys about the basics there's really two types of numbers and C that we deal with whole numbers and decimal numbers and whole numbers are basically referred to as integers and decimal numbers can be referred to as two things either floats or doubles and essentially the only thing you need to know about that as a beginner is that doubles allow you to store more specific decimal points so the double you could store you know potentially more decimal points than you could in a float and there's more differences but if you want to get more into that you can come to look it up but the basics of using numbers is you just type them out so if I wanted to for example print out the number 4 do you see I have this C out here I can just type it in and we can print it out we can work with it in addition to positive numbers we could use negative numbers if I wanted I can make this a decimal so really numbers are very simple you just kind of type out the number but we can also do things like math so for example I could say like 5 plus 7 and in addition to printing out 5 and 7 this is actually gonna do this math operation so this will actually print out the result of 5 plus 7 so you can see we get 12 over here so we can use addition we can also use subtraction we could use division which is gonna be this forward slash and we could use multiplication which is going to be this asterisk so if I was to multiply these two numbers now you'll see over here we get 35 so those are the four basic math you know operations so that's gonna work really well also one other thing I want to show you guys which is called the modulus operator and the modulus operator will basically give us the remainder of dividing two numbers so if I said like 10 and then I made this % and actually this is red 10 maude and then I said three so we would read this 10 mod 3 what this is gonna do is it's gonna take ten divide it by three and then it's gonna give us the remainder so this modulus operator will give us the remainder so 10 divided by 3 is gonna be 3 with a remainder of 1 so now we just we should just get 1 and you can see over here we get 1 so sometimes that modulus operator can come in handy we can also represent order of operations and C so C is going to adhere to like the normal or reparations like PE DMS I think it is please excuse my dear Aunt Sally basically like multiplication and division are gonna come before addition and subtraction so if I said for example like 4 plus 5 times 10 this is gonna do 5 times 10 first so it's gonna be 50 plus 4 so we get 54 but if I wanted to do the addition first I could just put parentheses around this so now it's gonna do 5 plus 4 9 times 10 so now we should get 90 and you can see we do so if you need to separate order of operations I mean it's essentially just following basic math order of operations rules but you could represent those like that so in addition to doing all that stuff and just printing out numbers we can store numbers inside of variables so I can make an int we'll just call it like W num for a whole number and we'll just make this 5 I could also use like a double and this will be like d nom for decimal number and this would be like five point five right I mean now we're storing these numbers inside of variables if I wanted I could just you know print them out naturally like we did down here I want to show you guys one cool thing we can do though which is incrementing a number that's stored in a variable so I could say like W num and I could say plus plus and what this is gonna do is it's gonna add one on to www.seagrant.umn.edu is gonna do is it's gonna take double unum and it's gonna add a T to it so now we should get eighty-five and you see we do you can do plus equals multiplication equals minus equals I think you can do division equals and all of that will it's basically shorthand so you don't have to type out all that stuff so now that we kind of looked at all the different operators let's talk about how decimal numbers and integers work together so here's a little experiment let's say I came down here and I added five point five plus nine so I'm adding a decimal number and I'm adding it to a integer number right so let's see what happens over here you'll see that we're gonna get a decimal number back so anytime we're doing math between a decimal number like a double or a float and an integer a whole number we're always gonna get a decimal number back so it's always gonna give us the decimal back but it's important to note though if I did math with two integers so for example let me show you guys if I was to say like ten divided by three and these are both integers keep in mind I'm actually gonna get an integer number back so we're gonna get like three back because that's technically the answer but here's the thing this isn't actually the answer really what it is is it's three with a remainder of one but because we did the math with two integers we're going to get an integer value back if I was to make one of these a decimal number or even if I made both of them a dozen a decimal number now we're gonna get back the actual like full answer so it's gonna be three with three repeating just like that so you can see if we do math between just two integers we're always getting an integer back even if that's not like fully the correct answer and different circumstances you're gonna want to do that in other circumstances you're not but just keep that in mind so that's kind of how integers and decimal numbers interact with each other so now what I want to do is show you guys how we can use different math operations so it generally just with math there's all sorts of different like I guess operations so you can do like square root you could take a number to a power we could round a number and in C there's actually these things called functions what you can do all that stuff for us a function is basically just a collection of code that we can call that will perform a specific task and we're gonna talk more about functions later but for now I'm gonna show you some basic math functions that we can use in order to use these math functions I actually have to do something called importing them and essentially when we import something we're basically going and we're telling C++ that we need to go out and grab code from other files so up here you can see we're using this include statement and we're grabbing something called iostream I'm gonna add another line here we're just gonna put a hash tag we're basically just gonna copy this guy up here I'm making open and closed greater-than less-than sign and in here I just want to type in C math and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna tell our C++ program that we want to use some math functions that's kind of all you need to know at this point just know that you need to put this up here in order to follow along with what I'm gonna be doing so down here we can now use a bunch of different math functions essentially just math operations so for example I could say like P o W and what this will do is it'll take two arguments so in here I could pass two numbers like I could pass a two and I could pass a five and what this will do is it'll take to raise to the power of five and it's just gonna print that out so when I run my program you'll see we're getting 32 so 32 is 2 raised to the fifth power and you can kind of do that with any number so I could also say like 3 raised to the third power so 3 cubed and now we should get 27 which we do so that pows can be pretty useful there's another one square root s qrt essentially doing the opposite so we can say like square root 36 and now this is gonna give us the square root of 36 back which is gonna be 6 so that can be pretty useful and inside of these functions we you can put a decimal numbers too so I could put both integers like whole numbers and also decimal numbers there's another one which is called round which is gonna round a number so if I put like 4.3 inside of here this will return rounded number so you see we just get four and this will follow a normal rounding rule so if I change this to four point six now we should get five back there's a couple other of these functions which will similarly like round decimal numbers I could say C EIL and what this'll do is it'll automatically just round the number up so even if this was like four point one this will round the number up to the next highest whole number so you'll see here we get five you could do the opposite which is floor so if I just say floor here if I put a four point eight in here normally it's supposed to round up but now it's gonna round down because we're using that seal or that floor function so those can be pretty useful and there's one more I want to show you guys which is called F Max and F Max is gonna take two numbers so I can pass in like a three and a ten and this will tell me which one's bigger so this will return back to us to the bigger of the two numbers so now when I run this program you'll see it's giving us a ten back because ten was the bigger number and a lot of circumstances in C you're gonna have two numbers you might not know which one is bigger so this can be really useful to tell us and you could also use F min which will do the opposite so this will tell us what the smallest number that we passed in was and you can see we get three over here so those are some basic math functions there's a lot more if you just go online and search c++ math functions like you'll find a huge listing of all of them that you can use there's things to do like sine cosine tangent you can do like the logarithmic stuff you can do you can use like Exponential's all different stuff like that it can be really useful but that's kind of the basics of how you can use that and you know really numbers are extremely useful and that's kind of been like an broad overview of sort of all the stuff you can do with them

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to get input from a user in C++ a lot of times in our programs we're gonna be working with all different types of information but one of the most important types of information is going to be information that the user input so a lot of times in our programs we're gonna want to allow the user to input information and then we're gonna want to use that information in order to do different things so in this tutorial we'll just give a broad overview of how that's done we'll talk about how to get different types of information and you know you'll kind of learn everything you need to learn so down here whenever we're getting information from the user the first thing we always want to do is store that information somewhere so whenever I'm asking the user to give me a piece of information if they give me that information and I don't put it anywhere like it's kind of useless right so usually what we want to do is create a variable and I'm actually gonna write a little program that will allow the user to enter in their age so I'm gonna create an integer just called age and I'm not gonna give it a value so I'm just gonna put a semicolon there we're essentially declaring the integer so we're telling C++ that we want to use this integer but we're not giving it a value we're gonna let the user give this variable a value the next thing I want to do is I want to prompt the user to enter in something right so if I don't give them a prompt from gonna tell them what information I want then they're not gonna know what they should input so I'm just gonna say C out and I'll just print out a little prompt so we'll just say enter your age and we're basically just prompting them to enter in their age all right so once we've created the variable and once we've prompted them to enter in the information now what we can do is we can actually get the information from them so the way that we get information is actually the opposite of the way that we print out information so instead of saying see out I'm just gonna say C in and I'm gonna make two greater than sign so when we use C out we use these less than signs when we use C in we use greater than signs and that's really important so over here I'm just gonna type in the name of the variable that I want to store what they enter inside of so I'm just gonna put age here because I want to store whatever they input into this a variable so we're assuming that they're going to enter in an integer number and I'm gonna store that integer number inside of this integer that we created now what we can do is we can just print out something so we'll print out a little message to them basically saying like you are and then we'll say like age that we can say like years old cool so now we're basically just asking them to enter in their name we're taking whatever they input and we're storing it inside of this age variable we can do that using this C in command here and then we're just printing out you are the age years old so let's go ahead and run our program and we'll see how we did so I'm gonna build and run and you'll see here it says enter your age so we can just put like 30 and now when I click enter it's gonna take that integer that we entered and therby it's gonna store it inside of the age variable it's gonna print out the prompt so when I click enter you'll see it says you are 30 years old so that's awesome so we can do that and we can get an integer I could also get a double so if I made this a double it would be the same thing so here I can run the program and I can enter in like 4.5 so maybe someone's like four and a half years old and here they're entering in 4.5 so it's gonna work the same exact way you could also do the same thing for characters so if I made this a char here it'll be the same so we'll be able to get a character from them as well so now when I have run the program I could just enter in like a G for example whatever obviously that's not the age but it does the same thing so it's able to take in that character and it's able to use it now here's the thing that's how we can get characters and numbers but if we want to get a string of text we're actually going to do something different so if I wanted to get a string I'm actually not gonna use this C in command so I'm going to show you guys how we can get a string so instead of entering in the age why don't we have them enter in their name so over here I'm gonna make a string and I'm just gonna call it name instead of using C and I'm gonna use another command which is called get line and get line will basically allow us to get an entire line of text so instead of just getting like one number or one character we're gonna get like the entire line that the user enters and in here we need to pass us a couple different parameters the first is going to be C in and C in is basically just that little like command prompt so like whenever we enter your stuff into that command prompt that's basically what this is saying and then we want to enter in the name of the variable where we want to store the line of text that we get so I'm just gonna store it inside of your name so over here we could just say hello to the user so I could say hello and it's gonna be named so now we'll be able to get the name from the user so we're basically get the entire line so for example I could come over here I could say like John Smith and now when I click enter it says hello John Smith so that's how we can get strings of text and that's really the difference is if I wanted to get like an integer in store inside of an integer variable if I wanted to get a char and store it inside of a char variable I have to use C in but if I want to just get like a string of text then I can use this get line function and they're both going to be useful so that's kind of an overview of how we can get input from the user and you could get as many values as you want it so you know you can essentially like copy this whole line paste it a bunch of times below there and get you know a bunch of different pieces of information and use them

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to build a basic calculator in C++ essentially we're gonna build a calculator where the user can enter in two numbers and then we'll add those numbers together and we'll spit out the answer so this is gonna be kind of cool and it'll show you guys a little bit more about getting input from users so down here the first thing we want to do before we do anything is create two variables where we can store the two numbers that we want to add together so I'm gonna create an integer and I'm just gonna call it num1 and I'm not gonna give this a value because we're actually gonna let the user give this variable a value I'm gonna create another one called num2 and same thing actually let me show you guys something cool we could do if we're creating two variables like this and they're the same data type I can actually put them on the same line so I could say num1 comma num2 and a lot of people find this to be really useful so for example I could do like as many as I wanted in our case we're just gonna have two numbers though so now that we've declared our two number variables the next thing we want to do is prompt the user and get some information so I'm gonna say see out and the first thing we'll do is prompt them for the first number so I'll say enter first number and now we want to actually get the first number from the user so I'm gonna say C in and over here I'm just gonna specify num1 so we're gonna store the number that they enter inside of this num1 variable i can actually just copy this and we're gonna do the same thing down here so I'm just gonna say enter second number and now instead of num1 it's gonna be num2 so at this point in our program we should have both of those numbers we should have gotten both of those numbers from the user the last thing we want to do is just print out the answer so we can actually just say see out and i'm just gonna add num1 and num2 together so we should be printing out the result of adding those two numbers together so let's go ahead and run this program and we'll see how we did so I'm going to build and run and actually whoops I put the wrong direction for these arrows here so this is probably a really common mistake with we want to make to greater than signs not to less than signs so that's something that could easily trip up a new user and it tripped me up so when we're using C in we're using these two greater than signs when we're using C out we're using these two less than signs that's my mistake but I guess that does kind of highlight a common mistake for beginners in C++ and even for someone like me who's programmed in C++ a lot before alright so now let's run our program and it says enter first number so entering a 5 enter second number will enter in a 10 and now when I click enter it should add both these numbers together so it does and we get 15 so that's pretty cool another thing we could do is instead of using integers we could also just use doubles and that's as easy as just changing these variable declarations so now when we run the program we can work with doubles so I could enter in like a 4 and I could also enter in like a 9.8 and now I'll be able to add those guys together so that's kind of cool and really that's a basic calculator so essentially we're declaring the variables up here we're using C out and with C out remember we're using these left Sun signs then we're using C in with the greater than signs and this line is basically getting to use the input from the user and it's storing it inside of this variable we're doing not twice and because we stored these as doubles or before integers we're able to add them together and print out the answer so that is the basics of building a calculator actually later in the course I'm gonna show you guys how we can build an even cooler calculator that'll be able to add subtract multiply and divide and the user will get to decide in order to build something like that we're gonna have to learn some more stuff so stick around and we'll learn how to do something like that later in the course

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to build a little Mad Libs game in C++ so a Mad Libs is basically a little game where you enter in a bunch of random words could be like nouns verbs adjectives and then all those words get taken and gets sprinkled into a story and generally since you entered in random words the story ends up being pretty funny so let me show you guys over here in my browser I just have an example of a mad lib you know essentially there's this story and then you would sprinkle in all those random words that the person enters into the story so we're gonna build something like this in our C++ program so down here I have my little program set up it's it's just this little poem it says roses are red violets are blue I love you so this is a you know sort of a classic poem but I think this could be a lot better if we turn it into a mad lib so let's say instead of saying roses are red why don't we let the user enter in a color instead of saying violets are blue we'll let them enter in a plural noun and instead of saying I love you let's say I love celebrity so some random celebrity they can enter in so basically we're gonna ask the user to enter in allthese different values we'll store them in variables and then we can print them out inside of our story so let's get started this should be kind of cool the first thing we want to do is actually create variables for all these things so I'm just gonna say string and we'll create a variable for the color for the plural noun and for the celebrity alright so now we've basically told C++ that we're going to use all these variables but we need to give them values and we're actually gonna let the user give them values when they enter in all those things the first thing we want to do when we want to get input from the user is we're just gonna say C out and we're gonna print out a prompt so I'm basically just gonna say enter a color so we're gonna have them enter in a color now we want to actually get the color that they input so I'm just gonna say get line and in here we're just gonna say CIN and that's basically just standing for like that console input so whenever we like input text into the console so it's gonna get whatever gets inputted into there and then we're gonna store it inside of this color variable so this will get the line of text that they enter and I'm actually just gonna copy this and we'll do the same thing for all the other values so we're gonna say enter a plural and down and we'll store that inside of the plural noun variable and then down here we're gonna do the same thing for the celebrity so we'll store that in the celebrity variable all right so we're declaring the variables we're printing out our prompts and then we're getting the input from the user using this getline function last thing we need to do is modify this part of the program so instead of saying roses are color we're actually going to put the color that they entered into the story same thing for this plural noun so I'm just gonna say plural noun and you can see how that gets placed in between these lessons and then I love celebrity we're gonna actually put in the celebrity variable cool all right so now our program should be set up everything's wired up we're getting values into all these variables and they're printing them out down here in our story so let's run this program and we should be able to play our mad libs enter a color why don't we enter in magenta and enter a plural now let's do microwaves and enter a celebrity why don't we do Tom Hanks so now when I click enter all of the values are gonna show up in our story so it says roses are magenta microwaves are blue I love Tom Hanks awesome so our mad lib worked and we are ready to go so that's essentially how you can build a mad lib I mean it's it's as easy as getting different inputs from the user and printing them out inside the story but this is a very simple mad libs I mean I'm sure you guys could see that you could ask the user for like 20 different words and print them out into some huge long story and it's gonna work out the same way so this is an awesome way to create our mad libs game

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about using arrays in C++ a lot of times when we're writing programs in C++ we're gonna be dealing with large amounts of data and one way that we can keep track of and manage that data is by using something called a variable but the one thing about variables is that generally you can only store one value inside of a variable so if I create like a character variable I can only sort of one character if I create an integer variable I can only store one integer in there a lot of times though in C++ we're gonna be dealing with huge amounts of data and that's where arrays can come in array is basically a container a lot like a variable but unlike a variable arrays can hold multiple data values so an array could hold like a list of you know thousands or millions of pieces of information and generally we could put you know pieces of information that are related to each other in some way inside of the same array so I'm gonna show you guys how we can create arrays and how we can work with them you create an array a lot like you create a normal variable so the first thing we have to do is tell C++ what type of data we want to store inside of the array so I'm just gonna make an array of integers so I can just say int and again just like a variable we're gonna give this a name so I could say like lucky nums right and this would be an array of lucky numbers now here's where this gets different from a variable when we're creating an array we always want to put an open and close square bracket after the name so after lucky nums we're gonna put this open and close square bracket and that basically tells c++ okay they want to create an array so they want to be able to store multiple pieces of information inside of this container now I'm just gonna say equals and one the easiest way to create an array is just to assign it some default information right off the bat and I can just make an open and close curly bracket and inside of here I can just start typing out the information that I want to store so let's say I want to store like a list of numbers I could say like 4 8 15 16 23 42 right so I'm storing all of these numbers inside of a single container so unlike a variable where we could only store one number now I'm stirring a whole list of numbers and we would refer to these as elements in the list so four would be the first element in the list and then we would delineate the next element using this comma so now we have the second element 8 15 16 et cetera so these are all going to be elements inside of our array now down here I'm going to show you guys how we can access individual elements so I'm just gonna say see out and let's say that I wanted to access one of these particular elements so let's say I wanted to access like this first element here inside the array because what good is the array if we can't access the information inside of it right I can just say lucky gnomes and I can make an open and close square bracket now inside of this open and close square bracket I can put the index of the element inside the array that I want to access so if I want to access this first element in the array I just need to put its index in here that's gonna be 0 so now when I run my program you'll see we're printing out four we're printing out that first element in the array if I wanted to get access to this 15 it's going to be 0 1 2 it's gonna be an index position to inside of this array so now when I run my program we get that 15 so if you haven't caught on by now when we index these arrays we start with index position 0 so I would say that 4 is an index position 0 8 is at index position 1 15 is a 10 x position 2 16 3 etc so we would always say that the first element in the array is actually an index position 0 and if you're familiar with how strings are indexed in C++ it's the same exact thing so that's how we can access an individual element in the array we could also modify an element in the array so I could say like lucky nums and like let's say I wanted to change the first element I could say lucky number 0 and I could give us a different value so I could set this equal to 19 for example now down here when I print out lucky number 0 I'm actually going to be printing out actually type of whoops I'm actually gonna be printing out 19 so you see we were able to modify one of the indexes inside of that or write another thing we can do with these arrays is I can give them a size so normally if I just create the array like this right it's a int lucky nums and an empty square brackets the array is only gonna be able to store the elements that I declare over here but a lot of times when you're making these arrays you might not know what all the elements should be so over here I could put in a number like I could say like 20 and essentially what i'm doing here is i'm telling c++ that i want to be able to store 20 elements inside of this locking nums array so over here i don't have 20 elements yet I only have elements 0 1 2 3 4 5 so what I can actually do is I can add more elements into here so I could say like the lucky numbers 6 or lucky numbers 10 and I could give this a value so I can give lucky numbers 10 the value of 100 and now down here if we printed out lucky numbers 10 it's going to be printing out a hundred as you can see another thing you can do is just not give this any info right up front so I can get rid of all of these and I could just put a semicolon here and then down here I can give all these different values so I can say lucky number is equal to 100 and now I can you know essentially just assign all the elements after we declare it so like I said a lot of times you might not know exactly what's gonna go in the array when you declare it and so you can just basically tell see how many items you want to hold in there and then you can just you know fill the array up as you go but that's really the basics of arrays and arrays are very simple so this is a very simple way to store multiple pieces of information

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about using functions in c++ a function is basically just a little collection of code that performs a specific task so a lot of times in C++ when you're writing a bunch of code out you have code that's designed to do a certain thing so you might have like four or five lines of code that's supposed to do something and a function is basically a container where you can put that code and then you can reuse it throughout your entire program so I'm gonna show you guys how we can create a function in this tutorial so down here to my program you'll see I have this little block of code here it says int main there's an open and close parenthesis and then there's these open and closed curly brackets this is actually a function this is a little block of code and this block of code performs a specific task and the purpose of this main function is it's the function that gets executed when we run our program so any code that we put inside of this main function is going to get executed when our program runs I'm gonna show you guys how we can create another function so up here above this main function I'm gonna create another function and the task that this function will be performing is it's gonna say hi to the user so whenever we're creating a function in C++ we need to give C++ a couple pieces of information the first piece of information we need to give is called a return type now whenever we create these functions a lot of times the functions will go off they'll perform a specific task and then they'll return a value back to the caller and we're actually going to talk more about returns and return types in the next video but for the purposes of this video you can kind of just follow along and I'm just gonna go ahead and put void here and when we put void here it basically means that this function is not gonna return anything so this is kind of like the most basic type of function and after we put void now we need to give this function a name remember function is a block of code that performs a task so generally when we're naming a function you're gonna want to name it according to the task that is performing or according to the purpose of the function so I'm just gonna call mine say hi because our function is going to say hi to the user now I'm gonna make an open and closed parenthesis and after this I'm gonna make an open and closed curly bracket any code that I put inside of this open and close curly bracket is going to be considered inside of the function so inside of here why don't we just say like C out and we'll just print out like hello user and that's basically all we'll do so this is a very simple function I just have one line of code in here I could have as many lines as I want this is a simple function but I can have you know a dozen lines or a hundred lines if I wanted to you can put as many lines of code in the function as you want now let's run our program and we'll see what happens so I'm gonna go ahead and run my program and you'll see over here nothing's getting printed out so hello user isn't actually getting printed out when we run our program here's the problem when we want to execute the code that's inside of these functions in other words when we want to execute a function we have to do something called calling it so if I want this code inside of here to be executed I have to call the function now remember the code inside this main function gets executed by default right so no matter what this is going to get executed so inside of here I can call this a high function I can just type out say hi and I can type an open and close parenthesis and when I do this when I type this out this tells C++ that I want to execute all of the code that's inside of this say hi function so when C++ sees this it's gonna jump up to this say hi function it's gonna execute all the code inside of there and then it's gonna come back down so let's go ahead and run our program and we'll see what happens so you can see over here now we're printing out hello user and real quick real quick I just want to show you guys the flow of these so if I said like see out over here and I said top and then I did the same thing over here and I said bottom when I run my program you'll see that we're printing out top hello user and then bottom and actually this probably would have been better if I put new lines in there but the point is that when this program executes C++ is going to execute this line of code it's gonna see that we want to call this a high function and it's actually gonna leave this main function it's gonna jump up here to this a high function it'll execute all of the code inside of here then when it runs out of code to execute inside of this a high function it's gonna jump back to the main function and execute this line so that's basically like the flow of what's happening so this is a very basic function but we can make this more complex and one thing you can do with these functions is you can actually give them information called parameters so this say hi function I could give this a piece of information and thus say hi function could use that piece of information to you know performance tasks differently or better or whatever so these are called parameters and if I want to specify that this say hi function should be given a piece of information I can just come over here and specify what piece of information it should take so in our case instead of saying hello user why don't we say hell out hello to someone specific so up here I could say like string name and now this function is going to accept one parameter a name and down here instead of saying hello user we can just say hello name now whenever I call this say hi function now because it's specifying that it needs to take a parameter I need to pass it a parameter I need to pass it a value so in here I can just pass it like Mike and now it's gonna print out hello Mike because the value Mike is gonna get stored inside of this name variable all right let's go ahead and run our program and now you'll see it's printing out hello Mike so that's kind of cool and you can take any piece of information as a parameter and you can also take multiple parameters so why don't we specify another parameter like age so now the caller is gonna have to pass in their name and their age so now we can say hello name and we'll say like you are and then we'll just say how old they are so we'll say like age so now we're passing in two pieces of information inside of this function and down here when I call the function I have to give it two pieces of information so now I can just say like Mike and let's say that I'm 60 so now when we call this function it's going to be able to take in both of those pieces of information and use them to perform the task differently and what's cool about these functions that could call this as many times as I want in other words I can reuse all of the code that's up here so I could come down here I could copy this and why don't we do this a bunch so we'll say like tom is gonna be 45 and say Steve it's gonna be 19 and so now I'm actually gonna run this code three different times and actually over here I'm just gonna put a end line so that gets printed out on new lines all right let's run the program and you'll see it says hello Mike you're 60 Tom's 45 and Steve's 19 so functions are great because we can reuse the code that we write inside the function so basically like I wrote this function one time and I can reuse it as many times as I want inside my program so anytime you have code that's gonna be reused a lot that's a good candidate for a function all right so I want to show you guys one more thing you'll notice that I'm creating this function up here above my main function right but if I was to take this and move it down here so for example I moved it below the main function now when I run my program we're gonna get an error you can see we're getting a little red block here this is a problem when we create this function below the main function it doesn't actually know about it so like all this code up here is getting executed so C++ is trying to execute this a high function but it has no idea like what that is because we created it down here so what we can do is we can actually create what's called a function stub so up here we're basically just gonna write out the functions signature and we're gonna tell c++ about it so you guys remember like if I created a variable like if I created an int and we just called it num I don't have to give us a value right away I could then come down here and say like you know I'm is equal to four or something this is basically what we're gonna do with this function we're gonna essentially just declare the function and then somewhere else in our program we can define it so over here I'm just gonna say void say hi and it needs a string name and it needs an int age and so now when I create this little function stub of here or this function signature I'm basically declaring the function and I can give it a value down here and now C++ is gonna be able to call it because it's gonna have some information about it so I don't run my program now we're able to call it no problem so that's kind of just how we can do that with functions and really you can create as many functions as you want in fact a good program will have lots and lots and lots of functions and the next tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how we can actually get information back from functions using the return keyword

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about returns in C++ so when I'm talking about returns I'm talking about returns from functions so in C++ we can write functions which are basically like little containers that store a bunch of code that performs the specific task and with those functions we can call them and we can also pass them information so I can give them all sorts of parameters and different information that they can use to perform their tasks better but in addition to giving functions information functions can actually give us back some information so when I call a function not only can I give it parameters but that function can give information back to me now I'm gonna show you guys how we can use this and how we can use the return keyword in C++ so why don't we create a function up here and actually want to create a function that's gonna cube a number so when I cube a number I'm basically taking it to the third power so if I was to say like two cubed it's basically just 2 raised to the third power or it's just gonna be 2 times 2 times 2 right that's what cubing a number does so why don't we create a C++ function that's gonna cube a number now when we create a function in C++ the first thing that we have to do is declare something called a return type and a return type basically tells C++ what type of value or what datatype this function is going to return now in the last tutorial if you're following along with the course we just put a void here and void basically meant that our function wasn't going to return any information in this tutorial though we definitely want to return some information so you can put any of the generic C++ type suit you could put like int double well you put character you could put string essentially any of those values can go here in our case we're gonna cube a number so why don't we just make it a double and I'm gonna say double and now we need to give this a name so I'm just gonna call it cube and we're gonna take one parameter into this function so why don't we take a double and we'll just call it num now inside of this function all we want to do is cube the number and then return the result that we get so I'm actually gonna create a double I'm gonna call it result and I'm gonna set this equal to the cubed value of num so I'm just gonna set it equal to num times num times num so this is basically me cubing num so now result has inside of it the result of cubing all these numbers okay down here I want to return the value that's stored inside of a result so I can just say return result and now this is gonna tell C++ that we want to return this value the sword inside result back to the caller now down here in my main function I can actually call this function so I could say cube and I could pass as a double let's say like 5.0 right now actually what's gonna happen is when we call cube and we pass it this information it's actually gonna get a value back so if I wanted I could basically say like double answer is equal to cube 5.0 and now the value that gets returned back from this cube function is gonna get stored inside of this answer variable so let me show you guys I can say C out and I'm just gonna print out answer and so now when I run my program what you'll see is we're gonna be printing out the result of cubing 5 and you'll see over here we get 125 so 5 times 5 is 25 25 times 5 is 125 so we're able to cube the number and you can see here this is getting a value back so I'm able to store the value that gets returned from this function inside of this variable if I wanted I could also cut out the middleman and I could just print out cube 5.0 so let's just paste this bad boy down here and now it's gonna do the same exact thing so we should get 125 cool and actually up here if we wanted instead of storing num times num times num inside of this result variable I could instead just return these guys up here so we would again cut out the middleman and we'll just return that and we should get the same exact answer all right so there's also one more thing I want to talk to you guys if which is this return statement this returned keyword right here this is a very special word in C++ and basically whenever we type out this return keyword it's essentially telling C++ that were done executing the code inside of this function so if I was to put like a C out here and I just printed out like Hello when I run my program now you'll notice that it's not printing out hello even though we're executing that cube function even though we're executing all that code it's never printing out hello that's because whenever we use this return keyword it's gonna break us out of the function so this line of code is actually never gonna get executed because it's never gonna get reached when C++ sees this line it's just gonna break out and we'll head back down to the main method so that's essentially what this is doing and that's sort of the basics of using returns so like I said if you didn't want to return a double you could return any type of day I mean a string you can even return something like an array so really you can return anything you want and then that value will get stored over here

in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about if statements in C++ now an if statement is basically a structure that we can use in our code which will allow our program to respond to different situations so when one situation occurs we can do one thing and when another situation occurs we can do another thing essentially we're able to check different conditions and when those conditions are true we can do certain things and when those conditions are false we can do other things so I'm going to show you guys exactly how this works down here at our main function I'm just gonna create a couple different things so the first thing I'm going to do is create a variable it's gonna be a boolean variable remember a boolean variable stores a true or a false value so I'm gonna create a boolean called Ismail and I'm gonna give this a value initially of true so we're basically creating this variable Ismail it's storing whether or not someone is male and I'm giving it a value of true now I want to show you guys how we can use an if statement and an if statement like I said allows us to respond to different situations so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be able to write an if statement that will respond to the situation where the user is a male and the situation where the user is not a male so what I can do is I can actually say if I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis and then I'm gonna make an open and closed curly bracket now inside of this open and closed parenthesis I can specify a condition so I can actually check a condition and if the condition that I put inside of those open and close parentheses is true then we're gonna execute the code inside of here if it's false then we're gonna move on so over here we're essentially putting a true or a false value and that's basically a condition right it's a true or false value so I'm gonna come down here I'll say if and I'm just gonna type out is male and essentially what this is saying is if the value stored inside of is male is true in other words if the value in here is true then we're going to execute the code that's inside of these curly brackets so I can say like C out and I'm just going to type out like you are a male and now when I run my program you guys will see what happens so run the program and you'll see over here it says you are a male and that's because the boolean is male was true so the value that was inside of this condition the value inside the parentheses which was true and we executed this code if I made this false now you'll see that this code isn't going to get executed so we're not going to be printing anything else so because the value inside of this parenthesis because the condition was false we're actually not going to execute this code but let's say that if the person wasn't male we also wanted to handle that situation I can use another keyword in C called else so I can type out else just like that and we're gonna make an open and closed curly bracket now inside of this opening close curly bracket I can put a message that's going to be displayed when this is false so I'm going to gonna say C out and I'll say you are not male right so I'm responding to this situation so now even though is male is false when I run my program it's gonna be able to respond to that so it's gonna say you are not male essentially what's happening here is my program is now smart enough to respond to this variable so if this variable is male is true it can handle that if it's not true it can also handle that and so basically inside of these parentheses I specified a condition in our case it was a true or false value that was stored inside of this is male variable so that's kind of cool now let's up the ante a little bit I want to show you guys how we can make these more complex this is a very simple example but let's say I added in another boolean so I had another boolean called is tall and I'm gonna set this equal to true and actually I'm gonna set this equal to true as well so now in addition to is male I also have is tall so let's say that we wanted to check to see if the person was both male and if they were tall so down here what I can do is I can use something called the and operator I could say is male and is tall basically what's happening now is C++ is saying if the person is male and the person is tall then we're going to print this out so I'll just say you are a tall male so this code this line of code down here and any of the code inside of these open and closed curly brackets is only going to get executed when is male is true and is tall is true essentially this and operator is allowing me to check two separate conditions and both of them have to be true in order for this line to get printed out so you'll see is male is true and is tall is also true so now when I run my program you'll see that it says you are a tall male here's the thing though if I set one of these to false so if I set is tall to false this whole condition is no longer gonna be true so then we're gonna go down here to this else block and this should probably say like you are not male or not tall but we'll just leave it like that just for demonstration purposes all right so now it says you are not male right and obviously like I said that message should be different but the point is that this condition was false because one of these values up here was false and that's how we can use this and operator there's another operator called the or operator and that is similar to and except only one of these conditions has to be true in order for the whole thing to be true so even though is tall is set to false and is male is set to true this is still gonna execute so it's still gonna say you are a tall male because one of them is true so let's go ahead and run this program now you'll see it says you are a tall male so it executed the code there was inside this initial if block and that's because one of them was true if I set both of these to false now because we're using the or now it's gonna go down to you are not male so you'll see down here it says you are not male so that's basically how we can use and and how we can use or with the and operator we can put two conditions and both of them have to be true for the whole thing to be true with the or operator only one of the conditions has to be true for the whole thing to be true and they can both be true as well and it'll be true but if both of them are false then it's going to be false all right let's make this even more complex so so I want to show you guys another thing we can do I'm gonna bring this back too and so I'm gonna say is male and is tall but let's say that we wanted to check to see if they were male and they weren't tall so if they were like a short male well I can actually check another condition so I can use another keyword in C++ it's called else if and I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis and open and close curly bracket and I'm just gonna bring this down to a new line so else if is basically saying if this condition up here is false then we're gonna come down here and we're gonna execute this condition so if this condition up here is false instead of just going to else we're gonna come over here and we're gonna check another separate condition so over here I want to check to see if they're male and they're not tall so they're not tall so I can say is male just like before so I'm saying else if is male and is tall but remember I want to check to see if they're not tall and here I want to introduce you guys to another operator it's called the negation operator it's basically an exclamation point and whenever you put this exclamation point before a condition like is tall it's gonna actually negate that entire condition so if is tall is true and we put this negation operator over here it's gonna set it equal to false and vice versa so essentially what I'm saying here is else if is male and is not tall that's basically what this is saying so now over here we can just print out you are a short male right because if this code in other words if this condition is true that means they're male and they're not tall so they're shorter male and there's one more that we can check so I'm gonna say another elsif over here and there's one more possible scenario with these variables up here that's when they're tall but they're not male so I could say not is male and is tall so this would be like you know it could be like a tall female or something right so down here I'm gonna go ahead and say see out and I'll just say you are tall but not male right so essentially I'm just printing that out only to the screen so now we have all of these different situations covered so over here in this if/else block which is what we would call this and actually down here in this else block we would want to change this so this is going to be you are not male and tall so that's just you know semantically going to be correct alright so we're able to respond to every possible combination of these two variables up here so let's try this out I'm gonna set both of these equal to true and now I'm gonna run my program so they're both equal to true so our program will be able to respond to that situation if you see it says you are a tall man awesome it was able to respond to that let's set is male equal to false so now we have is male false and is tall true our program once again is gonna be able to handle that so it's gonna say you are tall but not male so the program is smart enough now to be able to tell us what we are depending on the value of these variables let's try another one so we'll set is male 2 true and is tall to false and again it's gonna be able to respond so it'll say you are a short male and then finally we'll set them both false and we should get the answer which is gonna be you are not male and not tall awesome so we were able to figure this out just by using all this stuff so let me walk you guys through this one more time we have this if statement and it's checking if there are male and if they're tall now these are both conditions right so I'm checking this is male this is a condition essentially it's a true or false value right and then I'm checking is tall and if both of these are true then we'll execute the code inside of here if this is false then we'll come down here and we'll check this other condition we're gonna keep doing that until we get down here figure out okay they're not male and they're not tall stuff the basics of if statements and really this is just scratching the surface of if statements I talked to you guys about a lot of the different things we can do but there's one more thing I want to talk to you guys about in the next tutorial which are called comparisons and down here we're using these boolean variables in order to get our conditions right so I'm using these and these are either gonna be true or false right but we can also use something called comparisons and with comparisons we can check to see if different values will relate to each other in different ways so I could check to see if like a number is greater than another number or something and we can use those comparisons as our conditions and that's something pretty cool so stick around for the next tutorial and I'll talk to you guys more about these if statements

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys some more about if statements more specifically we're going to be looking at using comparisons inside of our if statement condition so this should be kind of cool in this tutorial I want to create a function so we're going to write a function and it's going to basically tell us the max of two numbers so this function will take as parameters two numbers and then we'll basically return whichever number is the largest and this is a great example of how we can use comparisons with if statements so over here I have my main function and up here I'm going to create another function and let's just say it's gonna return an integer and I'm just gonna call it get Max and we'll make an open and close parenthesis and an open and close curly bracket so inside of this function we're gonna take two parameters one is gonna be an integer and we'll get another integer so essentially we're gonna take two integers as parameters as input and the goal will be to figure out which of the integers is the biggest and return that back to the caller the first thing I want to do is just create a variable called result and I'm not gonna give this a value right away but eventually at the end of this function we're gonna return results so whatever we do in here we have to store whichever of these is bigger inside of this result variable so this should be kind of interesting now we need to figure out which is bigger so we can use an if statement to do that so I'm just gonna say if open and closed parenthesis and an open and close curly bracket now inside of this parenthesis we need to put a condition in other words we need to put a true or false value right if the value is true then we'll execute whatever is down here if the value is false then we'll just move on here's the thing though in the last tutorial when we were learning about if statements we were using boolean trite and a boolean is a true or false value so it's really easy right you just throw it in there and it's true or its false and you can just kind of do the if statement but in a lot of cases we're not gonna have any boolean information available to us so it's not going to be as easy as just like throwing a boolean in there all the only information that we have are two numbers so how can we create like a true or a false value using just those two numbers well what we can do is we can use a comparison so if I want to figure out which of these numbers is bigger I can just compare them right so over here inside of this if condition I can basically just say if num 1 is greater than num2 if num 1 is greater than num 2 then we can just set result equal to num 1 and the reason I'm doing that is because we know for a fact that if this condition if this comparison is true the num 1 is the bigger so you can see this comparison num 1 greater than num2 it's actually gonna get resolved down to a true or a false value right num 1 is either greater than num2 or it's not technically this is gonna be a boolean value right once you evaluate the comparison once we figured out if it's true or not it's gonna be a true or false value right so I can basically check to see if num 1 is greater than num2 and if it is what's that result equal to num 1 and we can just say else and we'll set result equal to num to right and the reason we're saying this down here B is because of this conditions false if num 1 isn't it bigger than num2 then we know that num 2 is the bigger of the two numbers or in certain circumstances the numbers gonna be equal but it's still gonna work anyway so down here we're gonna return the result so let's go ahead and test this function I'm just gonna come down here and why don't we print out the answer so I'm just gonna say get max and we'll throw it like a 2 and a 5 in there right so pass in a 2 and a 5 and now when we run this program hopefully we should get that 5 back so we run the program and yep over here we get our 5 so that's working perfectly so this is basically how we can use comparisons inside of these if statement conditions right technically this comparison is going to get resolved down to a boolean value it's gonna get resolved down to a true or false like either the comparison is true or it's not right and that's kind of interesting so that's one of the basics and in addition to using greater than we could also use less than we could use less than or equal to we could use greater than or equal to we can use equal to and equal to is a double equals so when we use the equal sign down here we're using it for assignment so I'm assigning the variable result the value stored inside num1 when i use this double equal as it's a comparison operator so i'm comparing the value of num1 with the value of num2 and again that's either gonna be true or false right they're either gonna have the same value or they're not and then the last one we can use is a not equals and not equals does exactly what you think it does this whole thing is going to be true if num1 is not equal to num two so those are sort of the basics now let's make this a little bit more complex so this get max function takes two integers what if we had it take three so let's say int number three now all the sudden instead of just comparing two numbers we have to figure out which is bigger among the three numbers and this is gonna make our if statement a lot more complicated so why don't we just start over and i'll show you guys how we can do this so inside of this comparison i need to check to see if num1 is bigger than num2 just like we did last time but i also need to check and see if num1 is bigger than number three if num one's bigger than num2 and it's bigger than num three then we know it's the biggest so let's start there I'm just gonna say if num1 and instead of just saying greater then i'm going to use a greater than equals right because there is that chance where they're all the same number in which case this will cover that so we can say if num1 is greater than equal to num2 and so i'm going to use this and operator and this is gonna allow me to check in another condition so I can say num one is greater than equal to num three so now if num1 is greater than equal to num2 and it's greater than or equal to num three then we know num one's the biggest so I'm gonna set result equal to num one now down here we need to check another condition so I'm gonna say else TIF and we basically want to check to see if num2 is greater than or equal to num one and num2 is greater than equal to num three and if this is the case in other words we're gonna check this condition if this condition up here is false so if this conditions false we know that num ones not the biggest right but if this condition is true down here then we know num2 is the biggest so we'll say result is equal to number two now all we have to do is just say else and down here we can just say result is equal to num three because if this condition is false that means num ones not the biggest if this condition is also false that means num2 is not the biggest so if num ones not the biggest and num2 is not the biggest then num three must be the biggest so we're gonna default to this value all right so that is the if/else block that we need and you see i'm using a bunch of different stuff here so not only am i using this and operator i'm also using these comparison operators and that's what these guys are called so let's go ahead and test our a little function out so now instead of saying two parameters we need to pass in three so imma pass in two five and ten and we should get ten back which we do if we wanted we could test out each of the positions so for example i could test out will make this one the biggest now the second one and we'll see if it works and it does and we'll make this one the biggest now and we'll see if it works and it does cool and then also there was that condition where like two of them were the same so let's try this where two of these guys are gonna be the same and we're on the program and yeah so it's still going to be able to return 200 so there is our max function and hopefully this gives you guys a little introduction into using comparisons now we can compare all different types of data so using these comparison operators we can compare integers we can also compare like doubles and floats and we can compare characters so you can compare all of those guys just by using all that stuff in there

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to build a four function calculator in C++ now if you've been following along with this course you'll know that in the beginning of the course we created a very simple calculator and basically that calculator was able to take in two numbers as input and it added them together and printed out the answer but in this tutorial now we've learned a little bit more in the c++ language we're gonna build a more complex calculator so this calculator is gonna allow the user to enter in two numbers but it's also gonna allow the user to specify which operation they want to perform so they can specify that they want to add the numbers or multiply the numbers divide them multiply them whatever so it's essentially going to be a more powerful calculator so down here inside of my main function I want to start writing the code for this and the first thing I'm gonna do is create a few variables so I want to create a couple variables and why don't we just create these as ants you can also make these doubles if you wanted we'll just call them num1 and num2 and these are gonna represent the two numbers that we want to perform the operation on and then down here we're also going to want to create a character and I'm gonna call it o P for operators so we're gonna store the two numbers here and we're going to sort the operator here so it's either going to be plus minus division or multiplication alright so now that we've created those two variables we want to start writing the code to get the input from the user the first thing that we want to do is print out a prompt so I'm just gonna say C out and I'll basically just print out enter first number so we'll prompt them to enter in the first number and then down here we're gonna use C in and remember you wanted these these 2 greater than signs and we want to store the users input inside of the number 1 just like that okay cool so now that we got num1 I'm actually just gonna copy this code and then down here we can paste it two more times so down here we're gonna ask them for the operator so I'll say enter operator and we're gonna store the operator inside of that opie variable just like that and then finally we're gonna enter in the get number and we'll store it inside of num2 so basically what I'm doing is I'm prompting the user for all of the information that we need so we're gonna get that first number we're gonna get the operator and then we're gonna get the second number so they'd give me like five plus two or six divided by seven or something like that alright so now that we have all of that information we have one more thing that we need to do which is we need to figure out what the user wants to do right over here we have the operator so ideally they would have entered in like a plus sign a minus sign whatever but we don't know what exactly they entered in like we don't we have no idea what what they were gonna enter in so we need to figure that out and this is a perfect scenario for an if statement so I'm gonna use an if statement and I'll show you guys how we can check this so I'm just gonna say if and we need to put a condition in here so basically what we want to do is we want to figure out what that operator is so the first thing I'm going to do is just check to see if the operator is equal to a plus sign right so if the operator is equal to a plus sign then we're basically just gonna print out the result of adding the two numbers together so why don't we come up here and I'm going to create an integer called result and then down here we'll set result equal 2 num1 plus num2 and we know that we want to add them because if this condition is true then we're going to execute this code all right so now let's do an else if and down here I basically just want to check to see if it's a minus sign so I'll say if opie is equal to a minus sign and if it is equal to a minus sign then we can do exactly what we did up there but we can subtract the two numbers so I'll say number one - num2 all right so we can do the same thing for multiplication and division so I'm actually just gonna copy this else if and I'll paste it down here and now we'll say oh P is equal to forward slash that means division and then one more time we're gonna do this for multiplication so use this asterisks and then here we're going to multiply the two numbers so now we're basically covering all of the operators so if they enter in a plus sign and we got that covered assign divisions on a multiplication sign right we can cover all of those standard scenarios but there's always the chance that the user entered in an invalid operator so instead of entering in one of these they just entered in some like you know random character in which case I'm going to use an ice block over here and this else block is going to get executed whenever none of these conditions are true so if none of the conditions are true then we know they entered an invalid operator so I'm just gonna go ahead and print that out I'm gonna say C out and we'll just print out invalid operator all right so basically by the end of this if block we should have a value stored inside of result so down here we're just gonna print it out so I'll just say C out and we'll print out resolved all right so let's see if our program works I'm gonna go ahead and run the program and it says enter first number so why don't we turn in a 5 enter operator let's enter a plus sign and Succot number why don't we do 30 so now when I click enter hopefully our if statements gonna execute we'll be able to figure out which operation I was trying to do and then we'll be able to perform it correctly so you see down here we printed out 35 so it looks like everything worked so why don't we try a couple other ones let's do like 50 divided by 5 so down here we get 10 yes it looks like that's working all right let's check one more thing let's check to see if we enter in an invalid operator so I'm gonna put like a 5 will enter the operator let's make it like a capital G and then put a 9 for the second number and you'll see down here it prints out invalid operator and then we're also getting this other little print out here and actually that's just because we didn't give result we didn't give result an initial value all right so that's basically our four function calculator you guys can see how we can combine getting input from the user then we can use these if statements to basically figure out what the user input and that can be extremely powerful

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about using switch statements in C++ now a switch statement is basically a special type of if statement which allows us to check one particular value against a bunch of other values so this is a very special use case when we're trying to compare different things so I'm going to talk to you guys about what switch statements are and we'll do an example which will kind of illustrate what they are doing so in my program in this tutorial I actually want to create a little function which is going to be able to convert a number into the day of a week so basically if the user passed in a zero to this function I'd want to be able to print out like some day or if the user passed in a one I'd want to be able to print out Monday etc so I want the function to be able to convert an integer number to a day of the week just like that so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do this inside of our C++ program so I'm gonna create my function and we're basically just going to have it return a string and I'm just gonna call it get day a week just like that and I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis and this is going to take one parameter which is gonna be an integer and we'll just call it day num so this is gonna be the number of the day of the week so like 0 through 6 basically alright so inside of our little function now we need to figure out how we can do this so depending on the day of the week in other words depending on the day num that they give us we want to be able to return a different value so the first thing I'll do is I'm gonna create a variable and it's just gonna be a string and I'm just gonna call it day name so this will be like this will end up storing the name of the day that they requested and then down here at the end of this function we're gonna return it so I'm just gonna say return day name so now we know what we're gonna end up returning so our goal inside of this function now is to populate this day name variable with the correct day of the week so let's think about this I mean one way that we could build this function is by using an if statement so I could say like if day num is equal to 0 and if daenam is equal to 0 then I can say day name is equal to Sunday right that works and then I can just keep doing this for every day of the week so I can say like else if and again I have to check to see if day num is equal to something else so daenam is equal to 1 and then down here we'll do the same exact thing so it was a day name is equal to Monday right I can keep doing this for every single day of the week here's the problem though I'm gonna have to do this like seven times right potentially eight times if we want to check for an invalid input so I'm gonna have to create eight of these different if-else structures in order to figure this out and that is extremely inefficient and actually this is a perfect circumstance for us to use something called a switch statement now a switch statement essentially takes what we're doing over here with these is if-else statements and it makes it a lot easier so one thing I want you guys to notice is in every single one of these conditions in other words in every single one of these if conditions we're checking to see if the same value daenam is equal to a different value so in here we're saying daenam is equal to zero here we're saying daenam equal to one and the next one it would be daenam equal to 2 then daenam equal to 3 all of those conditions are checking to see if daenam is equal to something else and when you have a situation like that it's a perfect candidate for a switch statement so I'm gonna show you guys how we can use a switch statement to make this a lot easier I'm just gonna write out switch and open and close parenthesis and an open and close curly bracket so so far it looks a lot like an if statement up here in these open and close parentheses I'm gonna put in a value and we're basically gonna put the value in here that we want to compare to all those different values so in my case it's gonna be daenam right I'm comparing daenam to 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 et cetera right daenam is the value that I want to compare to all the different values now inside of this switch statement I can write cases and basically I can say case and then I can just put a value in here so I could say 0 and a colon and then down here I can basically about what I want to happen so I could say de name is equal to some day now essentially what this is doing is it's saying in the case that de num is equal to zero we want to set de name equal to Sunday and then right below here I'm just going to say break and I'll explain what break does in a second but I can basically make one of these cases for every single number so I could say like case 1 so in the case that de num is equal to 1 I'm gonna set de name equal to Monday and then again I'm just gonna say break and then I keep doing this for 2 3 4 5 6 etc right so what this break is doing down here this break statement is essentially breaking this out of the switch statement so if I don't put this break statement here C++ is actually just gonna keep looking through all these cases so even if daenam is equal to 0 and it sets it equal to Sunday it's still gonna keep going and checking all these different values unless I say break right here and generally it's a good idea to say break unless you want to be able to check for more than one condition we're basically saying in the case the de num is equal to zero we're gonna do all the code down here and I'm actually gonna make one of these for each day of the week so I'm gonna go off and do that and then we'll meet back here and I'll kind of show you guys what I have alright so I went ahead and made one of these little case blocks for every day of the week so you can see down here we have 0 through 6 and they're all corresponding with the appropriate day so in case three day name is Wednesday except right so everything seems to be working now there's one more thing that we have to do in this switch statement so down here there's always the chance that the user enters in an invalid day of the week so in other words if the user doesn't enter 0 through 6 then we want to be able to handle that in other words I don't be able to handle the situation where the number that they entered isn't in here and inside of a switch statement we have a special little block which is called default so we can just say default a colon and then down here this code is gonna get executed if none of the cases up here are true so if the num isn't equal to any of these numbers up here then this code inside the default block will get executed so down here I could just say de name is equal to in a valid de number all right so now we have our switch statement set up and you can see how this is a lot cleaner than something like an if statement so this is a lot clearer what's going on we don't have to type out else if like a thousand times we don't need all those parentheses and all that stuff basically it's just really clear it's really easy to visualize what's going on all right so let's see if our get day the week function is working I'm gonna go in here and we're actually gonna print out the value so I'll say C out and we'll call this okay say get day of week and we need to pass this an integer so when we pass it as a zero and hopefully we should get printed out here Monday or Sunday whoops yeah so over here Sunday so Sunday would be the first day of the week well let's try let's even get Monday so I'm gonna put one here instead of a zero and now we should get Monday yeah awesome all right let's try one more we'll try six so six is gonna be Saturday and I'll see if it works cool so Saturday worked as well all right there's one more situation which is where we pass in an invalid number so if I pass in like a 10 here now we'll be able to see that this isn't gonna work so it should tell us invalid day number awesome so this is a pretty cool function and it's working and you can see how we can use these case statements in order to make this a lot easier now here's the thing I could have easily done this with an if statement nothing is stopping me from doing that but it's a lot easier to use something like a switch statement and that's why C++ included it in the language

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to use while loops in C++ now a while loop is basically just a programming structure that allows us to loop through a block of code while a certain condition is true so with this tutorial we're starting into something called loops and loops are extremely useful and there's a lot of situations in our program specifically in C++ where we're gonna want to be able to loop over code and do things a bunch of time so I'm gonna introduce you guys to the most basic type of loop which is a while loop and we'll sort of see what it does and see how it works all right so down here the first thing I'm gonna do before I create my while loop is I'm actually just gonna create an integer and I'm just gonna call it index and I'm gonna set it equal to one so this isn't a hundred percent necessary when you're creating while loops that we're just gonna use this in our example in this tutorial know when I want to create a while loop I can basically just say while I can make an open and close parenthesis and an open and closed curly bracket and this is sort of like the main structure the main outline for a while loop now here's what's gonna happen okay over here inside of these parentheses I'm gonna specify a condition now if you remember learning about if statements in C++ this is essentially what we're doing here so in here we're putting a condition just like we would an if statement and as long as this condition is true I'm gonna loop over and continually execute all of the code that's inside of these curly brackets as you see in a second we're gonna put a bunch of code inside of these curly brackets and as long as the condition up here is true we're gonna keep looping through that code and every single time we loop through that code we're gonna check this condition so let me just show you guys this and we kind of get a feel for what's going on so up here in these parentheses I can basically just write a condition so what I want to do is I'm gonna say while index is less than or equal to five so this is now my condition while index is less than or equal to five I'm gonna execute the code inside of this loop so I'm gonna execute the code inside of these curly brackets so down here what want to do is I basically want to print out the value of index so I'm just gonna say see out index and then I'm also gonna say and I'll so we print out a new line and then down here I'm gonna increment the index so I'm just gonna say index plus plus so you remember index plus plus just adds one to index essentially alright so what I'm doing is I'm specifying my condition while index is less than or equal to five I want to execute all this code so I'm gonna run my program and maybe you can sort of see already what this is gonna do but if not we're gonna run it we're gonna take a look at what's happening so you see over here when I ran my program we basically got one two three four five here's what's happening over here I created this variable called index us a to equal to one and I basically told C++ that while index is less than or equal to five I want to keep looping over this code so basically what happened was the first time we went through we checked this condition so we check to see if index is less than or equal to five since that was true in other words since index was one on the first iteration of the loop we executed this code so we printed out one and then we incremented index so index was now equal to two then we came all the way back up here and we checked this condition again so we checked to see if index is less than equal to five in this case index is equal to two so the condition is true index is less than or equal to five so we're gonna execute all of the code inside of here again so we printed out two and then we incremented to up to three and then we came back up we checked the condition again every single time we go through the loop we check that condition so before we execute the loop we execute that condition we go back up check it again and execute the code again eventually we got to the point where index was equal to six so we came up here to check this condition and six is not less than or equal to five so then we just came down we broke out of the while loop and everyone was happy so that's essentially what we did and that's what a loop is basically specify a condition as long as that condition is true then you're good to go and can pretty much just keep looping through all the code in there and there are tons of situations where using the loops is gonna come in handy and in the next tutorial we're actually gonna build a little game where we can use a while loop but before we do that I want to talk to you guys about a couple more things with these loops the first thing you need to watch out for when you're using these loops is something called an infinite loop an infinite loop is a situation where this condition up here never becomes false so in certain circumstances like the condition that you specify up here won't become false ever and then your Luke will just continually loop through so for example if I was to get rid of this line of code right here where we're incrementing index now index is always going to be 1 and so this condition up here is never gonna be false so when I run my code you'll see over here that we're just continually printing out one you can see the screen keeps flashing really what's happening is we're just looping looping looping looping through that while loop and it's never gonna stop me I could leave this on for years and it's never gonna stop right because that condition is never going to be false so you always want to make sure that any conditions that you write with these while loops at some point are gonna become false now there are certain circumstances where you're gonna want a while loop but I would say for the most part while loops aren't gonna be necessary and they can actually be dangerous especially if you're doing something where you're like creating variables or allocating memory like you can end up crashing your program or even crashing your computer if you're not careful so that's just a little tip about infinite loops there's one more type of loop that I can show you in this tutorial and it's a different type of while it's kind of like a different flavor of while loop but before I show you that I would just want to show you demonstration so if I make this int index equal to 6 when I run my program the code inside of the while loop is never gonna execute and that's because before we loop through all this code we check this condition first so before I'm allowed to execute any of this code I check the condition up here in these parentheses so I check to see if index is less than or equal to 5 since index is starting out at 6 we're never ever going to execute this code right so if I ran my program you guys will see nothing gets printed out right so we didn't do anything but there's another type of loop which is called a do-while loop and I want to show you guys how we can make one I'm just gonna cut this and I'm gonna paste it down here and I need to include a semicolon and then up here where that Ryle used to be I'm just gonna say do and this is what's called a do-while loop and a while loop is essentially just a normal while loop but it's reversed so instead of checking the condition and then executing the code we're gonna execute the code and then we're gonna check the condition so it's just sort of like the while loop reversed so now even though index is equal to 6 I'm still gonna be able to execute this code first then we're gonna check the condition and it's not gonna let me do it again so let me show you guys what happens when I run this and you'll see over here we're able to print out that 6 that's because with the do-while loop you execute the code in the loop before you check the condition and there's a bunch of different situations where you can use while loops or do-while loops and to be honest with you everything that you can do with the do-while loop you can do with a normal while loop so do our loops aren't technically necessary but in a lot of circumstances they are useful so that's why they're included in the language yeah I mean that's a basic overview of loops is actually another type of a loop that we can talk about in a future tutorial called for loops but for now you know practice with these while loops you can kind of see like how they work

in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how to build a little guessing game in C++ and this is gonna be cool because we're actually gonna be able to use some of the stuff that we've been learning up to this point in the course so we use things like wow loops if statements we'll use variables we use all sorts of stuff in order to build this game so essentially how this is gonna go is the user is gonna try to guess a secret number right so I'm gonna have a secret number stored here in my program and the user's job will be to try and guess what that number is so the concept of the game is pretty simple and as you'll see in a second it's actually pretty simple to program something like this but here's the one caveat is if the user doesn't get the guests right on the first try I want to keep asking them keep prompting them to enter in another guest so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do this so the first thing I want to do is create our secret number so I'm just gonna make an integer and I'm just gonna call it secret num I'm just gonna set this equal to I don't know let's say seven so seven is gonna be our secret number and then the next thing I want to do is create another integer which we're gonna call guess and I'm not gonna give guests a value right up front so now we have our secret number and we have our guests and we want to be able to keep asking the user to guess what the secret number is until they get it right so whenever something needs to be done continually that's usually a good sign that we want to use a while loop so I'm gonna go ahead and say while I wanna make an open and close parenthesis and I'm gonna make an open and close curly bracket so inside of this while loop we want to continually ask the user to enter in the number until they get it right so what I want to do here is specify a condition in other words I want to keep looping Wow the secret num is not equal to the guess so as long as the guess is not equal to the secret num in other words as long as the user hasn't guessed correctly I want to keep going through this loop now every time through the loop I want to prompt the user to input a number so I'm just gonna say C out and we'll basically just say enter guess so they're gonna enter the number that they want to guess and then down here we want to be able to get that answer it want to store it in a variable so I'm just gonna say C in to greater than signs and I'm just gonna put guess here so basically what we're telling C is that we want to take whatever the user enters store it inside of the guests so basically every time we go through this loop the user is going to be guessing and then we're gonna check their guess against the secret num if they got the secret num right then we'll just break out of the loop so down here if they end up getting out of the loop that means they got the guessed right so I can just print out you win so we'll give them a success message all right so this is essentially all we need to build our guessing game so I'm gonna go ahead and run this program and we'll see how we did all right so it says enter guests so I'm just gonna enter in some numbers so you can see I entered in a three that wasn't the secret number so I can keep entering in different guesses and no matter how many times I guess it's gonna keep asking me to guess until I get it right now let's try to get the guests right so the secret number was a seven so when I enter a 7 in now all the sudden the condition that was in that while loop is gonna be false so the secret num is going to be equal to the user's guess and we'll break out of the while loop and it's gonna say you win so that's essentially how we can build our little guessing game now I will say down here I created this game using a while loop right but there's actually another way that we can build this using a do-while loop so your homework for this tutorial is to go off and see if you can do this using a do-while loop instead of just a normal while loop all right so here's the thing this is actually a pretty fun game and it works out we were able to program it really easily but the games a little bit unfair it's unfair in the sense that the user gets essentially unlimited guesses so they think guess is many times as they want and honestly that doesn't seem fair so what we could do is we can impose some sort of a guess limit so I could say hey the user is only able to guess like three times and then they lose the game right so I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys how we can actually program something like that we're gonna need to add in a couple extra variables the first variable I'm gonna add in is going to be called guest count and this variable is basically just gonna keep track of how many times the user has tried to the secret number so every time the user guesses a secret number we want to increment the guest count and I'm actually going to set this equal to zero initially because the user will have guessed zero times then down here every time the user guesses I'm gonna increment the guest count so I'm just gonna say guest count plus plus so now we're basically able to keep track of how many times the user has tried to guess the secret number all right we're gonna make another variable over here and I basically just want to call this guess limit and guess limit is going to specify how many times the user is able to guess until they lose so why don't we set this equal to three so we'll say that the user gets three guesses they can't get the word in three guesses then they're gonna lose the game all right and then one more thing we want to create another variable which is going to be a boolean and this is going to be called out of guesses and I'm gonna set this equal to false initially so out of guesses will tell us whether or not the user has any guesses left if out of guesses is false that means the user has guesses left right because they're not out of guesses if it's true it means they don't have any guesses left because they ran out of guesses all right so now that we have these variables I want to show you guys how we can modify this a while all right so down here every time we go through this while loop you'll see that we're letting the user guess the number but here's a problem if the user doesn't have any guesses left then we don't want them to be able to guess the number right in other words if they've reached the guessed limit we don't want to give them another guess so what I can do here is I can actually use an if statement and what I'm gonna say is if guest count is less than guess limit so if the guest count is less than the guessed limit then I'm gonna let them guess right because if this conditions true up here that means that they still have some guesses left right they haven't reached the guests limit so then they're gonna be able to guess we'll increment the guest count etc otherwise though if the guest count isn't less than the guest limit that means that they ran out of guesses right so what I want to do is I want to toggle this boolean so basically I want to say out of guesses is equal to true so I'm telling my program that they ran out of guesses all right so once we've set this equal to true now we're basically done inside of this wire loop right so every time we go through we're checking to see if they have any guesses left if they do then we let them guess otherwise we tell our program that they're out of guesses there's one more thing that we have to do to this while loop which is modify the condition and up here in this while loop condition we can use this and operator and this and operator will allow me to put two conditions inside of there so I could say while secret num is not equal to guess and we can check another condition so what I want to do is I want to check to see if they're out of guesses so I want to check to see if out of guesses and I want to check to see if they're not out of guesses so we're gonna keep looping as long as they haven't guessed the secret word and they're not out of guesses right if one of those becomes false so if they run out of guesses or if they guess the secret word then we're gonna break out of the loop so that's essentially what's happening here all right so one more thing down here below the while loop we have this C out and we're just printing out you win but this isn't technically correct because if the user runs out of guesses then they're gonna break out of the loop but they didn't win so we shouldn't tell them that they won we should tell them that they lost so what I'm gonna do is make another if statement and I'm gonna check to see if out of guesses so if out of guesses is equal to true then I just want to print out a you lose message and otherwise if it's not equal to true in other words if they had guesses left that means that they want so that means they guess the secret word all right so let's go ahead and run this program and we'll see how we did all right so down here it says enter a guess so why don't we try to lose the game so I'm just gonna say three four and two so this is our last guess if we don't get it on this try that means that we lose so you lose right so we lost the game all right so looks like it's working so now instead of being able to guess infinite we can only guess three times let's see if we can win the game now so we're gonna guess like a three a two now we're on our last guess I'm gonna say seven and when I enter this it says you win so we were able to win the game as well all right so this is sort of how we can use all these different programming structures together so you'll see down here not only did I use this while loop and not only did I use all these variables but I also use if and else in combination with all that stuff and really this is what real programming is gonna look like you know it's not just gonna be like little simple examples it's gonna be a little bit messy just like this not that this is messy code but we want to be able to use all of these different programming structures in combination there's also one more thing I want to tell you guys which is the way that I wrote this little algorithm this little function here we could have written this like a dozen different ways so I could have programmed this game and you know I could think of like at least two or three other ways that I could have done this and this is another lesson in programming is that generally there's gonna be like five or six different ways to do the same thing so I could have done this with a do-while loop I could have used different things I could have used like a break statement or something else and so that's one of the cool things about being a programmer is it's going in and trying different ways to do the same thing but that's basically how we can build this guessing game hopefully you guys learned a little bit about seeing all those different structures like ifs and Wiles and variables and all that stuff you used together

in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about four loops in C++ well four loop is a special type of loop which actually allows us to keep track of how many times we've gone through the loop so in a four loop we can use something called an indexing variable basically that indexing variable will allow us to keep track of how many times we've gone through the loop and you can also use the indexing variable to do a bunch of other stuff too so I'm going to show you guys how four loops work we're gonna look at why they're useful and in what situations you're gonna want to use them so over here you'll see that I have this basic program set up and essentially I just have a while loop over here so I have this a integer it's called index and I just said equal to one and then Wow index is less than or equal to five I'm just printing out the value of index and then I'm incrementing it so I'm gonna go ahead and run this program yes and kind of see what's happening so you'll see we're basically just printing out one two five all right so this is a very simple while loop and if you've been following along with this course and you've you know hopefully you're familiar with what while loops do at this point but I want you guys to notice a couple things so this while loop is special because every time we go through the loop this variable index tells us what iteration of the loop we're on so when I run this program you'll see over here like the first time we go through the loop index represents one right index has the value of one the second time we go through the loop index has the value of two third time has the value of three etc right so this index variable is essentially telling us what iteration of the loop were currently on right in other words on every iteration of the loop the value inside of this index variable is changing so it's in our case it's incrementing by one but the point is is that we have this variable this index variable and it's essentially just keeping track of how many times we've gone through the loop now in C++ and in just about every major programming language this is a very very powerful looping structure in other words there's a lot of situations where keeping track of you know how many times we've gone through the loop or even just having a variable that's gonna change every we go through the loop is very useful and in fact this is such a useful situation that there's actually a special loop just to do something like this so there's a special type of loop whose sole purpose is to provide us with a structure very similar to this where we have this indexing variable that is going to change every time we go through the loop and in a lot of circumstances it's actually gonna represent what iteration of the loop were currently on and that's called a for loop so I'm gonna show you guys how we can build a for loop and essentially a for loop is just gonna be exactly what we have up here it's just gonna be a lot more compact and a lot easier for us to use so it's great a for loop we can just say for make an open and close parenthesis and open a close curly bracket so so far it looks exactly like the while loop now the one difference with the for loop is instead of only having one thing up here in the parentheses so in this while loop we just have our looping condition right a lot of people call this like a loop guard down here in this for loop parentheses we're actually gonna have three different things that we want to include so the first thing that we want to put inside of this for loop parentheses is a variable declaration variable instantiation so up here you'll notice that I'm creating this indexing variable called index and I'm giving it a value of 1 so I'm declaring the variable and I'm assigning it an initial value right I'm initializing the variable inside of this for loop parentheses we can do exactly this so I could actually just copy this line and then down here I can just paste this in here and instead of calling it index why don't we just call it I so I is gonna stand for index we'll set it equal to 1 then you'll notice I have this semicolon here after I put this semicolon we can actually put another line so another thing that we have in this while looping structure is our loop guard right this loop condition it's essentially telling us when we should loop so if this condition up here is true then we want to keep looping so that's the next thing that we want to put inside of this for loop parentheses so we're putting this variable declaration and initialization and then down here we're also gonna put the looping condition so this is going to tell the loop when it should stop and when it should all right so then what I'm also gonna put another semicolon here so you'll notice I have a semicolon here after we create this variable and I have another semicolon here after we specify the looping guard the next thing I want to do is put in a line of code that's gonna get executed after each iteration of the loop up here in this while loop you'll notice that we have this line of code over here index plus plus this line of code is going to get executed at the end of every single loop iteration so the last thing that we're gonna do when we go through this while loop is increment the index variable right so that's essentially what we're gonna put over here we're gonna put a line of code which is going to get executed after every iteration of this loop and in our case we're just gonna increment this variable I so I'm just gonna say I plus plus we're adding one two I now again I could put essentially any line of code here that I want I mean I can put like I

I could do you know basically whatever I want but in our case we're just gonna increment I just like we did up here with index so now inside of this for loop body inside of these open and closed curly brackets we can just put whatever we want to do on each iteration of the loop so that's gonna be this line up here so I could actually just paste this guy in right here and now we have a completed for loop so believe it or not this loop down here is actually equivalent to this loop up here you'll notice this took one two three four lines of code whereas this only takes two lines of code so like I said this is such a common scenario where we want to have a variable like index which is you know essentially changing every time we go through the loop and can allow us to keep track of things like the current loop iteration such a common situation that there's a special loop called a for loop for that and the for loop the first thing we do is create the variable just like I did up there so I'm initializing this variable the next thing we do is specify the looping guard the looping conditions that's what I did here and then we specify a line of code that's gonna get executed after every iteration of the loop which is going to be this I plus plus and you'll notice that these are all separated with some Cullens and you'll notice also that I don't need a semicolon over here so let's actually get rid of this while loop and I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys what happens we were on the for loop and actually I need to change these two eyes so instead of this being indexed I'm just gonna leave it as I and this is also gonna be I so we have in I is equal to one we're gonna keep looping as long as I is less than or equal to five and then at the end we're just gonna increment I so we're gonna say I plus plus and every time through the loop we are printing out I so let's go ahead and run this code and you'll see we get the same exact output as we did with the while loop so it's just still just one two three four five so what's cool about these four loops is we can essentially like keep track of a value every time we go through and in our case we're basically just keeping track of how many times we've gone through the loop I want to show you guys how we can use these four loops to actually iterate through the contents of an array so let's say I created an array of integers so we'll just call it like nums and I'm just gonna give this an initial value so won't we just say 1 2 5 7 3 all right so I have this array of integers and it just has a bunch of numbers in it and if you recall with integers if we wanted to access a specific element inside of this list I could just say like nums and then put the index in here so if I said num 0 this is gonna give us access to this one if I said nums 4 it's gonna give us access to 0 1 2 3 4 it's gonna give us access to this 3 what I could actually do is I can modify my for loop down here in order to actually loop through and print out all the contents of this array so array indexes start at 0 so I'm gonna start this I variable at 0 and what I'm gonna do is I'm basically gonna say I is less than the number of elements inside of the array so inside of this array we have 1 2 3 4 5 elements so I'm gonna say wow I is less than 5 we want to keep looping and then I'm just gonna say I plus + and down here instead of printing out I I could actually just print out nums I and what this is gonna do is on the first iteration of the loop it's gonna nums zero on the second iteration of the loop it's going to print out numbs one on the third iteration of the loop it's going to print out numbs two etc and it's gonna do that all the way up to numbs four which as we saw is gonna be this three so that's going to be the last element in the array so we can actually use this for loop to loop through all the elements in the numbers array so let's go ahead and do that and you'll see over here we're printing out all the elements or printing out one two five seven three so that is a very common situation we can use for loops to iterate over the elements inside of an array and it can be really useful so play around with these four loops these are extremely useful and one more time I just want to go over the structure so the first thing we're doing over here is we're creating a variable or we're initializing a variable so I'm saying int I is equal to zero and then I'm specifying my looping guard so my loop condition I'm saying we're gonna keep looping as long as I is less than five and then this is a line of code that'll get run after every iteration of the loop so every time we go through this loop we'll come up here run this line of code and then we'll check the condition again that is the basics of for loop this is a very useful loop I would say this is almost even more widely used than a while loop in a lot of situations so you definitely want to practice and play around these for loops
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how to build an exponent function in C++ now an exponent function is basically a function that will take a number to a specific power so I could write a function that I could pass in two numbers like if I passed in 3 & 4 this would basically give me back 3 raised to the fourth power so I'm gonna show you guys how we can build this and it will actually get a chance to use for loops so we can use a for loop in order to build this function and it's gonna be pretty cool so up here I'm gonna create my exponent function so we're gonna have this use a integer so I'm just gonna say int and why don't we just call this power because it's taking a number to a specific power I'm gonna make an open and closed parenthesis and open and close curly bracket now our power function is gonna take two arguments so it's gonna take a base number and it's gonna take a power number and we're basically gonna take the base number to the power of the power number so I'm just gonna say int and then int pound umm now down here in our power function we need to figure out how we can do this so I basically need to take base num2 power num and we can use something called a for loop in order to do that so the first thing i want to do is just create and a variable so i'm just gonna call it result and i'm just gonna set this equal to one and then down here I'm basically just gonna return a result so essentially our goal inside of this function is to get rid the result variable equal to the value of the base number a x'd to the power number right that's kind of our goal throughout this function let's just say for the purposes of simplicity and the purpose is just for of this tutorial that we're only gonna be able to handle positive number exponents so we're just gonna go ahead and assume that Panem is gonna be positive and now it'll just make it a lot simpler and kind of help me to drive home the point a little bit better what we're gonna need is a for loop and I'm gonna go ahead and write out this for loop now up here in the parentheses we need to specify three things the first thing I need to specify is a variable so I'm just gonna say int I is equal to zero I'll start this out at zero now what I need to do is specify a looping condition or a loop guard so I want to keep looping as long as I is less than the pound um essentially what I'm saying here is I want to go through this loop how num times so as many times as the pound um specifies I want to go through this loop so if pound um is 3 on a loop through three times if pound um is five I want to loop through five times that's basically what this is saying and then over here we can just specify something that we want to do after each iteration of the loop so I'm just gonna say I plus plus and basically will just be incrementing the value of I every time we go through the loop alright so down here inside of our for loop we need to think about what we can do so where are we already know that we're gonna be looping through here pound um times right so what I think we should do is we should multiply result times the base num every time we go through this loop so what I'm gonna say is result is equal to result times base num and the reason that this is gonna work is because let's just kind of break this down the first time we go through this loop right result is going to be equal to one so the first time we go through this loop we're multiplying base numb by one so we just get base um the second time we go through the loop result is equal to base num right in other words result has the value of base num so the second time we go through we're essentially multiplying base num times base number based on squared right the third time we go through this loop result has the value of base num squared so for moulting multiplying base number times base num that'll give us base num cubed so that's kind of why this is gonna work right so we're looping through this for loop POW num times and every time through the loop we're multiplying result times the base num and you can see this for loop is very useful because it allows us to only loop through the loop a specified number of times right it makes it really easy for us to only loop you know pound um times essentially alright so this is the basic function and this looks pretty good to me so again we're only gonna this is only gonna be able to handle positive number exponents so a positive number of pounds okay so let's go ahead and call this so I'm just gonna say actually why don't we print out the result so I'm gonna see out power and I'm gonna pass in two numbers so why don't we pass in two and three so we're gonna go ahead and do two cubed so now let's run this function and you'll see we're getting eight so 2 cubed is 8 2 times 2 is 4 4 times 2 is 8 let's try another one why don't we do 4 squared so now we should get 16 and you can see over there we get 60 and so looks like our little function is working and basically the point of this tutorial was just to kind of demonstrate to you another way that we can use these for loops so I'm using this for loop in order to essentially specify how many times I want to loop through something and for loops are really useful for that because we're keeping this count so I is representing how many times we've gone through the loop so on the third iteration of the loop I can tell us that we've gone through three times essentially and that's why this is useful and so you can see it's actually really easy to do something like that it only takes up like two lines of code so that's the basics of building something like a power function and actually this is kind of useful because you can kind of see how a function like this might get put together

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about two separate subjects in C++ the first subject we're going to talk about are going to be two-dimensional arrays and a two-dimensional array is a situation where we have an array where every single element inside the array is another array so this is a pretty cool situation and I want to talk to you guys about one other thing which are nested for-loops and a nested for loop is a situation where we have a for loop inside of another for loop so this is gonna be kind of cool and you'll see we can actually use these two subjects together two-dimensional arrays and nested for loops in order to build a kind of a cool program so I'm gonna show you guys the basics of doing that stuff first thing I want to show you is a two-dimensional array so I'm gonna go ahead and create an array of numbers and I'm just gonna call it number grid and normally when we create a regular array we're just gonna make an open and close square bracket but since we're making a two-dimensional array I want to make another open a closed square bracket after this now remember a two-dimensional array is a situation where we have an array where every element inside of the array is another array and I'm gonna show you guys how we can go ahead and set something like this up so I'm gonna give this an initial value so I'm just gonna initialize this and I'm basically just going to put a bunch of array elements inside of here so the first thing we're gonna do is create the first element in the array now normally if I was creating an array I could just kind of type out elements like this right you know I can kind of type them out delineate them with a comma and then we have our array but with the two dimensional array remember each individual element is actually another array so if I want to create one element inside this two dimensional array I can basically go like this right so I can make another sort of mini array inside of here and I'm actually just gonna format this a little bit and so now the first element in this number grid array is going to be an array with elements 1 & 2 so number grid first element is this array and this array has two elements of its own so I'm gonna copy this and we're gonna make another element so I'm gonna put a comma here because remember we need a comma to delineate the different elements and then down here I'm just gonna paste so now we're gonna do three and four so we have one two three four and why don't we do one more and we'll just do five six all right so essentially what's happening here is we have our overall array right so these two curly brackets represent the number grid already and inside of the number drin array we have three elements so this is the first element this is the second element and this is the third element all of which are arrays and each one of these arrays has one two elements inside of them so whenever we're creating two-dimensional arrays we always want to specify the numbers over here so inside of this first open and closed square bracket we want to tell C++ how many total elements are in the number grid array so in our case we have three because again there's one two three elements then over here we want to specify how many elements are inside of each array element so you'll notice we have 1 2 1 2 1 2 etc so there's gonna be two elements in each one of these arrays and it's very important especially when you're dealing with two-dimensional arrays that you specify these numbers because otherwise you can get really confused you know and so by specifying 3 2 I know the basic layout like I know that this array has 3 rows like you can call these rows and then it has 2 columns so these would be like columns essentially we're building a matrix all right so that is a 2 dimensional array and let's talk about how we can actually access some of these elements so if I want to access some of these elements I'm actually just gonna go ahead and print some of these out so over here I can just say number grid and what I can do is I can make 2 open and closed square brackets so I can go just like just like this and inside of these open and close square brackets these first ones I want to specify the row in other words I want to specify the element inside of number grid that I want to access so this would be of the at position zero this would be the element at position one and this would be the element at position two so let's say we wanted to access it this element right here I can put a zero here because it's inside of element zero and then over here I want to put the index of that element inside of the actual array so it's going to be an index position 0 1 so 0 again is corresponding to this overall element and 1 is corresponding to this element inside of that array all right so now when we print this out we should get a 2 and you'll see over here we get that too let's try one more why don't we try to get this 5 over here so 5 is gonna be an element 0 1 2 so we're gonna put a 2 over here and it's gonna be element 0 so we're just gonna put a 0 and now we should get that 5 which we do all right so that kind of shows you a little bit about how we can create a two-dimensional array and actually this same concept can apply to like n dimensional arrays so you could have a 3 or 4 or 5 dimensional array and all these same concepts are gonna apply obviously the more dimensions you add more complex it becomes but you can get pretty complex with arrays just by using this technique alright so that was the first thing I wanted to show you guys and now I want to introduce another topic which is a nested for loop and nested for loop is a situation where we have a for loop inside of another for loop and actually nested for loops can be extremely useful because we can use them to print out all of the elements inside of this two-dimensional array so basically we could iterate through all the elements inside of here using in nested for loop but I'm gonna show you guys how that's gonna work so down here I want to create a basic for loop so I'm just gonna say for and I'm just gonna say int I is equal to 0 again our goal here is to be able to loop through all of the elements in this array and you know as I sort of create this for loop just kind of stick with me eventually this is all gonna make sense but what I want to do is I want to keep looping while I is less than 3 and I'm using 3 here because I want this four loop to loop through all of these individual elements so all of the arrays inside of the number grid array then over here I'm just gonna say I plus plus so this for loop is responsible for iterating over all of these elements so this first element the second element in this third element one remember each of these elements is another array so what I want to do is for each of these arrays I want to iterate over each of the elements inside of those arrays so I can create another for loop to do that so I can say int and I'm just gonna call this J and a lot of times when we're using nested for-loops people will name these IJ that's kind of a convention I'm gonna set this equal to zero and I'm gonna keep looping as long as J is less than two and remember two is how many elements are inside each of these arrays right so this loop over here is responsible for iterating through all of these elements and this one down here is responsible for iterating through all of these elements so I'm gonna say J less than two and then I'm just gonna say J plus plus so now we have our basic structure set up for every iteration of this I loop this J loop is going to fully iterate so it's gonna go through all the way and down here I'm just gonna see out and I'm basically just gonna print out all these different elements so I'm gonna print out number grid I J and you guys have seen a second basically how this is gonna work and then real quick down here I'm just gonna see out a new line so I'm just gonna say see out ndele and that'll print kind of a new line so let's go ahead and run this and then I'll give you guys more of an explanation as far as what it's doing so when I run this you'll notice that we're actually printing out all of these elements so we're printing out one two three four five six so I'm actually able to go through and iterate over every single element inside of this two-dimensional array basically what's happening is every time we go through this top loop up here this I loop we're fully iterating through the J loop so this I loop is responsible for iterating over each individual element so it's responsible for iterating over this this and then this this J loop is responsible for iterating over each of the elements inside of those elements which are arrays so the J loop is gonna loop over this and this so the first time we go through this loop I is going to be equal to 0 and J is gonna be equal to 0 so we're gonna print this out then we're gonna go through this J loop again I is still going to be equal to 0 but J is gonna be equal to 1 so we're gonna print this element out and then I is going to be equal to 1 so it's gonna be 1 0 will print this out and then it's gonna be 1 1 so we'll print this out and that's essentially what's happening here so nested for loops and even like nested while loops I mean any sort of nested loop can be very useful and it can be useful for looping through like I said complex structures like that

in this tutorial I'll talk to you guys about using comments in C++ the comments are little special blocks of code which aren't actually going to get executed or rendered by C++ so a lot of times in your programs you're gonna want to you know basically write things that are meant for human beings so whenever we're writing programs like whenever we're writing a code or instructions those instructions are meant for the computer so I can tell the computer to print something out or I can tell the computer to loop over a block of code or something like that but a lot of times we're gonna want to write out messages just for human beings so either for yourself or for someone else and we can do that using something called a comment and I'm gonna show you guys what comments are essentially a comment is just a you know a little line of code or a block of code that C++ is going to ignore and therefore we can use it to write little messages for ourselves so in order to create a comment in C++ there's actually a couple ways we can do it the first way is just to make two forward slashes so when I make two forward slashes you'll notice that when I start typing all of this text is actually colored different than the text over here that's because this is a comment so any text that I put after these two forward slashes is gonna be considered a comment and it's not actually gonna get rendered by C++ so even though I have a bunch of nonsense up here I can still run my program and it's still going to be able to execute so you'll see I can run the program and there's no errors it's just printing out comments are fun so this is a really great way to kind of write a little note a lot of people will use this to write notes to themselves or maybe write notes to other developers you can also use this to like describe a line of code so I could like describe this line of code over here I can say like print out text right obviously you know you probably wouldn't need to describe this line but if you had like a complex function or you know complex loop or something like that a comment could come in handy you can also put these comments like after a line of code so I could just cut this out and paste it down here and you'll see that everything active that comes after these two forward slashes is gonna be considered a comment but I can still put code over here and again you can use this to like describe what the line of code is doing or something like that the one downside to this type of comment though is that it only works on one single line so if I come down here to the new line all of a sudden this goes back to normal text so this is no longer a comment if you want to have a long block of comments though you can use something called an opening and closing tag so if I make a forward slash and an Asterix then everything that comes after this even if it's on a different line is gonna be considered a comment so you can see all of this stuff is now a comment but I can close this off by saying in asterisks and another forward slash but now everything that's in between these two tags is gonna be considered a comment and these two types of comments are very common and you know pretty much either one you use is going to be correct and it's gonna work out so that's basically how the you know the two types of comments and how you can use them another way that comments are useful is for commenting out lines of code so a lot of times when you're working with your programs maybe you want to try to run your program without a certain line of code and you might be running into a problem and you think a certain line of code is the culprit well one option would be to just remove the line of code so for example let's say that this line of code was potentially like messing up my program and I wanted to see how the program would act without that line of code well I could just delete it save the file and then run the program and now we're running the program without that line of code the problem with that though is I have to physically delete the line of code right if I wanted though I could just put a comment in front of it and now this entire line is gonna get ignored by C++ so it's essentially the same as removing it but we don't actually have to physically remove it from the file it's still gonna be there we can still see it we still know that it's there it's just not gonna get executed so that's another useful way that comments can come in handy so yeah I think a lot of developers use comments and you definitely want to take advantage of them in your programs when they're appropriate

In this tutorial, I want to talk to you guys about pointers in C++ now a pointer is basically just a type of information that we can work with in our programs if you can follow along with this course up to this point we've been working with all different types of data so we're working with things like integers which are whole numbers we've been working with doubles which are decimal numbers we're working with strings and chars which are like plaintext and in this tutorial I want to introduce you guys to another type of information we can deal with which are called pointers and pointers are basically just memory addresses so we're gonna kind of get into what that means what is a memory address we're gonna talk about all that stuff and I'll give you a full introduction into pointers so over here in my program I have a few different variables that I created I have an integer called age and I gave it a you know a value a double called GPA and a string called name now all of these are variables in my program right so in other words all of these are essentially just containers where I'm storing specific information for my purposes when I'm writing this program I'm storing the value 19 inside of this age variable right I'm storing 2.7 inside of this GPA variable but let's kind of you know go underneath the hood a little bit and talk about what's actually going on here so in everyone's computer you have something called your memory and another word for this would be RAM so you might have heard people talk about Ram stands for random access memory it's essentially just the active memory that your computer is using when it's running programs so whenever your computer runs a program it's using Ram so it's storing information inside of this memory let's just say our program for example so in the case of this program if I was to run this program my computer would actually be using Ram in other words my computer is going to use its memory in order to store and keep track of information in fact it's going to be storing all of these values inside of its memory so when I create this variable age and I give it a value what's actually happening is my program is going to take this value 19 and it's going to store it inside the physical memory of my computer when I create this double GPA my computer is gonna take this number and it's gonna store it physically inside of the memory in my computer same goes for that string so for all of these different pieces of data they're all actually getting stored inside of the memory of my computer so when I write the program like for my purposes I just know that 19 is stored inside the age variable but when we go underneath the hood 19 is actually stored in side of the computer's memory so it's physically stored in the memory now one of the cool things about the memory of our computer is there's a bunch of these little containers right each one of these variable is each one of these values is essentially just like inside of one of those containers right that's kind of a broad strokes explanation but you can basically think of it as like this number 19 is stored inside of a container in memory this value 2.7 is stored inside of a container in memory and each of the containers inside the memory of my computer where these values are stored has an address alright so it has an address which uniquely identifies it so for example this value 19 is stored inside the physical memory of my computer and it's stored at a specific memory address this value 2.7 is stored in the memory of my computer and it's stored at a physical memory address and so when my program wants to access this value it can access it by using that memory address when I want to access the variable I can just access it using like age or GPA but when my computer wants to access it my computer has to access it using the physical memory address so that's kind of like what's going on and I want to show you guys how we can go ahead and access that physical memory address so I could actually print it out I could to say see out and if I wanted I could basically print out the memory address where each of these variables are stored in other words I could print out the memory address where this value 19 is stored I can print out the memory address where this value 2.7 is stored all I have to do is just make an ampersand and then I can type in the name of a variable so I could type in like age for example and what this is gonna do is when I put this ampersand here it's essentially going to tell C++ that I want to print out the memory address where the age variable is stored in other words I want to print out the memory address where this value of 19 is stored so when I run my program you'll notice over here that I'm getting this kind of crazy numbers so it's 0x 6 AF ee 0 this is a hexadecimal number basically it's just some long number that would be very difficult for a human being to remember but the computer is able to remember it just fine so if you were to go to this physical memory address inside of my computer you would find the value 19 I mean that's essentially what this is doing right so that's basically like where that value 19 lives inside of our memory right so if I wanted to access or change your modify it my program can do it using that address and that's essentially what we're talking about and in C++ we have a word for these addresses so we have like a special word that we use when we're talking about addresses it's called a pointer so generally if I'm working in C++ and I want to talk about a memory address I'm gonna talk about pointers so I would say that this is a pointer right so over here we could say that I'm printing out a pointer and a pointer is just a type of information it's just a memory address so any memory address that we're working with or that we're using inside of our programs is going to be considered a pointer and the way that we can access the pointer of these variables are in other words the way that we can access the memory addresses where these variables are stored is by using this ampersand so I have a little demonstration alarm show you guys this is just a block of code that I wrote out before the tutorial and it's essentially just printing out all of the memory addresses for all of these variables so I'm gonna go ahead and run this so you can see over here I'm essentially just printing out all the individual memory addresses for all of these variables so we have age and it's located at this memory address we have GPA at this memory address and name at this memory address so all of these memory addresses if we were to go to them in our like physical RAM and the physical memory of our computer we would see those values and again we would call these pointers so this is a pointer this is a pointer pointer is just a memory address that's just a type of data we're just giving it another name so that's kind of cool and that kind of shows you guys how we can access like the memory addresses of these different variables but we can actually take this a step further so I want to show you guys another thing that I can do so I can actually create a variable where I could store the pointer so over here like I'm creating an integer variable and inside of it I'm storing an integer right over here I'm creating a double variable and I'm storing a double over here I'm creating a string variable I'm storing a string and actually if we want to manage and keep track of the memory addresses or the pointers inside of our programs we can create a pointer variable so I'm going to show you guys how we can do that and a pointer variable will basically be just a container where we can store a pointer right it's a container where we can store a memory address generally when we're working with memory addresses in our programs we're not just gonna work with random addresses right in other words like I don't know any like meaningful memory addresses off the top of my head so generally when we're using memory addresses we're going to be using the memory addresses of the different variables in our programs so therefore when we create an actual pointer variable in other words when I create a container what I'm gonna store a pointer I'm generally going to create it based off of one of these variables so let's go ahead and create a pointer variable that will store the pointer for this age variable I'm just gonna say int and whenever we create a pointer variable you always want to use this special character which is gonna be the asterisk and then you want to type in the name of the variable so I'm just gonna call this P age and a lot of times when you're creating pointer variables you'll use this lowercase P and then you'll type out the name of the variable whose memory address you're storing so I could say int P H is equal to and now I can just say ampersand age so remember when we use this ampersand and then we type out the name of the variable that gives us the pointer in other words that gives us the memory address where the value is stored so I'm essentially storing this pointer inside of this variable over here called P age I could do the same thing down here for this double I could just say double asterisk and I'm gonna say pgpa and I'm gonna set this equal to ampersand GPA so now this P GPA pointer variable is storing inside of it a pointer in other words it's storing inside of it a memory address and it just happens to be the memory address of this GPA variable I can do the same thing for this string down here so I can say string P name and actually don't forget to put the asterisks and I can just set this equal to ampersand name and now this pointer variable P name is storing the pointer in other words it's storing the memory address of this name variable so now I can actually work with these different pointer values using these pointer variables so if I was to come down here I could say C out and I could just print out like P age and now this is gonna go ahead and print out the value that's stored inside of that pointer variable which is going to be a pointer which should be the memory address of P age so you can see down there that's exactly what we get so that's kind of useful and you know really I think a lot of times people get a little intimidated or may be confused with pointers but pointers are really simple a pointer is just another type of data that we can work with in C++ so you know you can work with things like integers which are whole numbers you can work with doubles which are decimal numbers you could work with strings which are just a bunch of characters you could also work with pointers what your memory addresses you know that's all it is it's just a different type of data and we when we create a pointer variable it's just a container where we can store a pointer that's kind of all it is now I want to point out to you guys whenever I created this pointer variable you'll notice that I used the data type of the variable that I was pointing to so this pointer variable is storing the memory address of an integer therefore I said int over here this pointer variable is storing the address of a double so I said double over here same thing down here this is storing the memory address of a string so I said string over here and that's basically just what you have to do when we're making pointer variables this kind of brings me to another point I want to show you guys one more thing we can do which is called dereferencing a pointer and dereferencing a pointer basically means that we're grab the value that's inside of the memory address so remember a pointer is a memory address so if I have a pointer that is a the address of a physical you know slot or a physical location in my computer's RAM in my computer's memory that's all it is it's just an address really you have an address for your house that's kind of what this is it's an address but instead of for a house it's for a memory location and when we dereference a pointer we're basically telling c++ that instead of using the actual pointer we now want to go to that physical memory address grab the value out of there and use it in our program and the way that I can do that is by dereferencing it so you'll notice like when I print out P age right this is a pointer so when I when I run this program and I print it out we get a memory address but if I was to dereference this pointer we would actually end up getting the value that was stored at that memory address so if I put an asterisk here this is what's called dereferencing a pointer so I could say asterisk P age and now we'll be dereferencing the p age pointer so now instead of getting that memory address when I run this program we're gonna get the value 19 because that is the value at the memory address that the pointer was storing and the the pointer was representing so I'm her in my program and you'll see down here we get 19 so when I get rid of this asterisk we get the memory address when I put the Asterix here were dereferencing the pointer so we just get 19 and that's kind of how that works so hopefully that makes sense I won't show you guys one more thing so dereferencing is really useful and if I just said for example like ampersand GPA right GPA is this variable up here it's storing the value of 2.7 this is a pointer right so this is gonna give me the memory address so over here when I run this we get this memory address but I could just dereference this and hopefully this kind of show you guys what we're doing so I can just put an asterisk here and this is gonna dereference this entire thing so now this asterisks is dereferencing this pointer and we should end up getting the actual value which is 2.7 you can see we get this value and you can I mean you chain these together not that you'd want to but I could say like ampersand and now we'll get the memory address again so that's kind of how that works and you know pointers and you know working with pointers doing stuff with pointers can be really useful in C++ this is also a very useful concept in another language which is called C and C is actually the programming language that C++ is based on you use pointers a lot in that C language but they're also important in C++ and if you're gonna be a C++ developer programmer you need to have at least a baseline understanding of what pointers are and how they work so hopefully that gives you a little bit of an idea of what they are remember essentially pointers are just types of information it's just another type of data that we can use in our programs we can print them out we can use them we can store them inside of variables we can also dereference them as you saw earlier in the tutorial so hopefully that helps and hopefully now you can kind of play around with pointers

in this tutorial I'm gonna teach you guys about classes and objects in C++ the classes and objects are extremely useful and this is a very important topic in C++ so I'm gonna give you guys a full overview of what these are and we'll kind of get an idea of how to create classes and objects so down here in my little program I just created a few different variables and basically what I'm doing here is I'm just storing different pieces of information right I'm storing my name inside of this name variable we're storing it inside of a string I'm storing pi the first three digits of pi in this double variable and then I'm sorry my favorite letter G inside of this character variable so just using these variables we're able to store a bunch of different types of information and actually if you know anything about C++ datatypes you'll know that by default C++ allows us to store a bunch of different types of data so we can store it like text we could store numbers we can sort like whole numbers decimal numbers we can store characters we can store all of these different types of information but here's the problem though and this is kind of a limitation to this is that there's a lot of types of information in other words there's a lot of things there's a lot of real world entities that can't just be represented using a string or a number or a character like there's a lot of things that we just can't represent with a string or a number or a character like like a phone for example like I can't really like represent a phone in my program using like a string or using just a number or think of something like a computer or a keyboard or an animal or a person like there's all these like real world entities that can't necessarily just be represented using the limited data types that we have right so we only have like a certain number of data types that we can use and those data types really aren't enough for us to necessarily model everything in the real world so imagine I was creating a program for example where I wanted to work with books like maybe I was creating a program for a library and inside of that program we needed to represent book like I wanted to be able to work with books and store books and use books inside of my program well there's no book data type right there's no like I can't just come over here and say like book you know my book whatever like there's no book data type for me to use so this is kind of a problem and you know forget about books for a second imagine any other you know real world objects like a person or a location or a musical instrument or really any type of like object in the real world that I'd want to represent in my program and so you know really the problem is we only have a limited data types right there's only certain types of data we can represent and this is where classes and objects come in so what we can do is we can actually create a class and a class is essentially a new data type so when I create a class I'm basically creating a new data type in C++ and that's really why classes are useful because we can kind of create a blueprint for a new type of data in our program so like I said before you know I can't just come down and down here and create like a book data type right but what I can do is I can create a class that will specify what a book data type is and then I can actually use that book data type that I created inside of my program so I'm gonna show you guys how we can do this let's write a program that will allow us to store and work with and represent books inside of our programs so we're essentially going to be creating a book data type in order for me to do this I'm just gonna come up here and I can do this in the same file as this main function I'm gonna create a class and a class is essentially just a specification or a blueprint for a new data type in our program so when I create a class I'm basically creating a new data type I'm creating a new type of data that we can work with and we can use you know programs it's pretty cool so over here to create a class I'm just gonna say class and then I'm gonna give this a name and generally when we're naming classes we are going to name them with capital letters so I'm just gonna make call this book so we're gonna create a book class so this book class is going to act as a blueprint or a template for the book data type okay so this is a justice specification right we're basically specifying what a book is inside of our program so what I want to do down here is I want to actually define the book datatype and we can do that by giving it attributes so we could basically say that a book is gonna have like two or three or five different attributes that will describe it and we're gonna use all those other data types like strings integers doubles two characters etc in order to represent those attributes so essentially this book class is going to be a collection of attributes which are going to be things like numbers and strings etc so I'm just gonna say public and I'm gonna make a colon here and then we're gonna come down here and I'm actually going to end up this so it's a little bit easier to see down here right below where I said public I want to specify some attributes so essentially I'm mapping out what a book is gonna be and what its gonna have so let's think about what are the different attributes of a book well the first and probably the most obvious is gonna be the title and we can represent the title as a string so I can just say string title and I'm just declaring these variables I'm not gonna give them values so what's another one let's think probably the author right so another attribute of a book would be the book's author and let's try to think of one more so I think another good one might be maybe let's do pages so like this would be the number of pages in the book and I'm sure you can think of a lot more we could think of like publishing date like publishing company you know you could think of all you know a version number there's a lot of different attributes we could store for a book but let's keep it simple for now essentially what I'm doing here is I'm mapping out a blueprint so I'm saying this is the blueprint for the book data type and a book in our program can have a title can have an author it can have a number of pages associated to it so this is a more of a complex data type really it's a it's a class so this is basically all we need so we're essentially just specifying what a book is we're telling c++ what a book is in our program so now I'm gonna come down here and I'm actually gonna create a book so remember this is just a blueprint this is the template it's a specification but this isn't like a physical book if I want to actually like have a physical book that I'm work with in my program I need to create it down here and we're actually going to be creating something called an object so here's a little terminology lesson a class is the specification it's the blueprint it's the template of a data type so this book class is the specification it's the blueprint of a book inside of our program an object is an actual instance of that blueprint or it's an actual instance of that class so an object is an actual book so I'm gonna create an object down here we'll call it a book object and that means it's a it's an actual book that's gonna have an actual title an actual author and an actual number of pages associated to it and we can create you know hundreds of these different objects but just to know that a class is the template it's the specification and an object is an actual instance of that specification so it's an actual book with an actual title author and pages so let's go ahead and do that I'm just gonna say book and again I'm basically just telling C++ what type of data I want to create or what type of data I want to store and then I'm gonna give this a name so I'm just gonna call it book one so now we have this book inside of our program it's called book 1 and what we want to do is start giving it some attributes so I want to say book 1 dot title and we can actually give this a title so I can assign a value to book one for the title so why don't we just say the title is like Harry Potter so this is gonna be a Harry Potter book and I can do the same thing for author and for pages so I could say book wan dot author and I can just give this an author so it's JK Rowling and we're gonna give this a number of pages so I could say book 1 pages and this is gonna be an integer so let's say it has like 500 pages and so now I'm actually able to represent and I'm able to work with a book inside of my program so again this up here is a class it's a template for what a book is this down here is an object it's a physical book in our program that has actual attributes so it has this is the Harry Potter book with the JK darling author and 500 pages so I'll show you guys what we can do we could actually print out this information so I could say see out and why don't we print out book one title and so now I'm able to store all of this information inside of this book one object so I'm basically able to represent a book in my program when I run this program now you'll see we're printing out the title of the book which is Harry Potter I could do the same thing for like pages so we could print out the number of pages in book 1 which is going to be 500 so this is a really cool way for us to actually model a real-world entity like a book inside of our program so remember before we didn't have a book datatype right I had nothing I could use to represent a book in my program now all of a sudden I have one so I can actually represent a physical book in my program and we could make as many of these as we wanted so I'm actually just gonna copy this and let's make another book so let's say in addition to this Harry Potter book maybe we want to make another one and I'm just gonna call this book 2 so I'm gonna change all of these so now all of these are set to book 2 and I'm gonna change all these attributes instead of it being a Harry Potter book why don't we make it a Lord of the Rings book and the author is gonna be Tolkien and let's say that this is like 700 pages so now I have two books in my program I have book 1 and I have book to book one has all of these attributes associated to it book 2 has all of these attributes associated to it but both of these books are using this same book template right they're using the same book class this is just a specification for what a book is and down here I was able to create individual instances of that specification in other words I was able to create individual book objects so I could also print out stuff about book 2 so now I could say like book 2 dot author and this is going to print out book twos author so now it's Tolkien so just like before when we have like integers and you know strings and stuff like that now in addition to those data types we also have a book so I can wrap a book I can use a book I can store it I can you know modify all its values and stuff like that and you know down here basically we're just defining the book and then we're giving it value so I can say like book 1 title and I could also change these so if I said book 2 title down here I could change it so I could change it to like Hunger Games or something and now book 2 dot title is going to be updated so these work just like normal variables would work and you can see now we're getting Hunger Games so that's pretty cool and honestly this is just a an introduction into classes and objects there's a lot more to learn about there's a lot more to talk about but hopefully this makes sense what you want to do is just play around with modeling a real world object so in here I modeled a book so I created a book datatype but you could create like a phone datatype you could create a like a keyboard datatype you can create anything you know essentially you're just taking a real world entity breaking it up into individual attributes like title author and pages and then you can represent it in your program

in this tutorial I'm gonna teach you guys how to use constructors inside of C++ classes now a constructor is a basically a special function that is going to get called whenever we create an object of a class so let me show you guys basically how this works so down here we're actually up here I have this class it's called book and if you're probably long with the course we created this class in the last tutorial and basically this book class is just sort of a blueprint or a specification for what a book is inside of our program so you know a book has a title has an author and house page is awesome so down here we actually created some book objects and an object is just an instance of a class so we have book 1 and book 1 has a title it's a Harry Potter book and an author and pages and all that stuff so I'm gonna show you guys where constructors come into play so a constructor like I said it's essentially just a function that's gonna get called whenever we create one of these book objects so up here I'm actually going to go ahead and create a constructor and the way we can create we can create a constructor is just by essentially creating a function for this program so I'm just gonna say book and I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis in an open and close curly bracket and essentially what we have here is a constructor so this is a special function now which is gonna get called whenever we create a book object so let me prove that to you guys I'm just gonna print something out and I'll just say creating object and then we also want to print a new line so down here I'm creating two objects I'm creating book one and I'm creating book two whenever I create a new object you guys are gonna see that this function up here is gonna get calls let me run this program and you'll see over here it says creating object twice so it says creating object and that was when we made this line of code and then down here it also says creating object and that was when we created this second object so we created two objects and this method or this function got called twice hopefully that makes sense now another cool thing about this book function is that it can accept parameters so I could come over here and we could say that this is gonna accept a parameter like name and over here I could just print out like whatever the user passed in so now down here when we create these objects we can pass values in so I could pass in like Harry Potter that's the name of this book and we could pass in like Lord of the Rings that's the name of this book right so now when I run my program it's going to actually be able to use those parameters so instead of printing out like creating objects as printing out the value that we passed into the constructor pretty cool right and constructors are awesome because we can use them when we create objects so let me point something out to you guys and I'm actually just gonna get rid of this stuff up here so we point something out when we wanted to create these objects right and when I wanted to give them a bunch of initial information so when I created book 1 and book 2 I had to manually specify what the title was gonna be what the author was gonna be and what the pages were gonna be and it kind of took up a lot of time right it takes a lot of time to have to manually type out book one titled book wand out there and I have to do that for every single object that I create well that gets really really tedious and imagine if instead of just creating two objects I wanted to create like a hundred or a thousand objects like that would take up so many lines of code I mean just to create one of these objects took up four lines of code we can actually use these constructors in order to initialize our objects with information so like when I create this book one instead of having to manually specify the title of the author and the pages instead I could just pass those values into the constructor and the constructor could initialize the values for us so let me show you guys how we can do that up here and our constructor I'm going to specify that this constructor is going to take three values so this book constructor is gonna take a string title and actually we're just gonna call this a title it's gonna take a string and we're gonna call it a author and it's gonna take an integer we're just gonna call it a pages and I'm putting this a here you don't have to do that I'm just doing it so it's kind of easy for us to see what's going on a is just gonna stand for argument so this will be like the title that's an argument all right so down here what I can do is I can actually assign the values of title author and pages to the values that we passed in so down here we're assigning the values of title author and pages to all of this information but instead of having to do it down here I could just do that up here in the constructor so I could say that the title is going to be equal to a title so in other words the title of the object the title that we want to store for this specific book is going to be equal to the title that gets passed in I could do the same thing for the author so I could say author is gonna be equal to a 1/3 and pages is gonna be equal to a pages and again you don't have to name these a title a author a pages you can name whatever you want I'm just kind of doing this so it's more obvious as far as what's going on so down here what I can do now whenever I create this object I need to pass it a title and author and a number of pages so if I tried to run my program right now you'll see we're getting an error and we're basically getting an error because we didn't pass in these values so what I can do is I can actually take the title I can take the author and I can take the number of pages so 500 and I can pass them in to this constructor then I can just get rid of all this code because we don't need it anymore and I'll do the same thing for the lord of the rings' book so I can and we can pass in the number of pages and so now we can get rid of all this stuff so we went from having eight lines of code to create two objects so now we just have two lines of code and now when I run my program we should be able to essentially just give this object a bunch of initial information so let's go ahead and print out this stuff so you can kind of see what happens so I'm just gonna see out why don't we see our book one title and let's see what we get so we should get Harry Potter which we do so we did exactly what we were doing before except we were able to do it a lot easier and a lot cleaner now by using this constructor so this was a very very powerful tool for us to use now I also do want to point out we could still modify these so I could still say like book 1 title and I could change the title so I could change the title to whatever I want and it'll be updated really all we're doing with this constructor here is we're just making it a lot easier so we're essentially just making it easier for us to initialize a object with different values so that's sort of the basics of using constructors and I'll show you guys one more thing we can do you can actually create multiple constructors so I could create this constructor that will essentially just allow us to take in a title and author and a number of pages but let's say that for some books we wouldn't want to include one of those attributes I can make another constructor over here and this constructor for example won't take in any parameters and I could just give these values like initial value so I could basically just say like title is equal to no title author is equal to no author and we could also say like pages is equal to 0 so this is basically just giving this object like some initial information if we don't pass anything in so now what I could do is I could come down here and I can create another book so I could say like book and we'll call this book 3 and I now I don't have to pass in this information so if I want I can just do that and we can print out like book 3 dot title and it's gonna be that title that we gave it and this needs to be capital whoops so now you see we get no title so a lot of times people will create multiple constructors you're basically giving the user multiple ways that they can create your objects but I'd say the most common scenario is going to be this where you pass in all of the attributes and then they basically just get assigned so that's the basics of constructors hopefully that makes constructors are very useful so you're definitely gonna want to use them in your C++ classes

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about object functions in C++ you'll also hear people refer to these sometimes as like instance functions and essentially what this is is it's a function that we can put inside of one of our classes and then the different objects of that class can use that function in order to either you know find out information about themselves or modify information about themselves so I'm just gonna give you guys a sort of introduction into how to do this now over here you'll see that I actually set up a class and this class is called student and this is essentially just a template for like what a student is gonna be in our program and I've said down here that a student is gonna have a name a students gonna have a major and a student is also gonna have a GPA so that information is sort of like what defines a student in our program and then down here I created a constructor which basically just allows whoever's creating these objects in order to pass in some initial information and we're passing in a name a major and then also the GPA so I'm essentially just using this constructor as I normally would any other constructor so this is our student class and then down here in my main method you'll see that I actually have a couple students so I created a student called student one his name is Jim he's a business major and his GPA is two point four and then I have another student student two her name is Pam she's an art major and she has a GPA of three point six so these are now two students that I'm working with and I'm sort of representing inside of my program so that's awesome so let me show you guys how we can use these different object functions let's say that we wanted a way to figure out whether or not one of these students was on the honor roll right so let's say that at the school that these students attend there's an honor roll right and let's say that the rules for being on the honor roll is you need to have a GPA of 3.5 or above so if you have a GPA of 3.5 or greater that means that you're on the honor roll and let's say that we wanted to have an easy way to figure out whether or not a specific student was on the honor roll well what I could do is I could create a function up here in my student class which each of the objects can use to tell if they were on the honor roll or not so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go down here below the constructor and I can basically just create a function like I normally would so we can give this a return type and I'm gonna give this a boolean return type and I'm gonna name this function has honors and this function is basically going to return a true or a false value it will return true if the student has honors right it'll return true if the student has a GPA of 3.5 or greater if they don't it's gonna return false so over here we're not gonna have to take in any information we don't need any parameters I'm gonna make an open and closed curly bracket now down here inside of this function we need to figure out if the object has honors so I can just use an if statement I'm just gonna say if and I'm basically just gonna say if GPA is greater than 3.5 or actually if GPA is greater than or equal to three point five then we're gonna come down here and we can just return true because if this code gets executed that means that they have a GPA of 3.5 or greater and then otherwise if that's not the case we can just return false so that's essentially all this little functions going to do it's very simple if they have a GPA of 3.5 or greater turn true otherwise return false now what's cool about this function is each of the objects that I create can call this function and depending on their specific GPA it's gonna return a different answer so for example let's go ahead and call this on our first student gym so I can just say C out I just want to print out the answer and I can just say student one dot has honors so now if I want to figure out whether or not jim has honors I can just call this function I can say student one the dot has honors and now this is gonna print out whether or not jim has honors so you'll see over here we're printing out a zero and just a tidbit whenever you print out boolean values if it's a false it's gonna get printed out as a zero if it's a true it's gonna get printed out as one so the fact that we're seeing a zero here means that student 1 doesn't have honors and we can do the same thing for Pam so we could do the same thing with our other student I could say student to dot has honors and now this should be true because Pam has a GPA of three point six so Pam is gonna have honors what's cool about doing this is that this function is going to be using different information depending on which object is calling it so when the Jim object calls it the GPA is Jim's GPA when the Pam object calls it the GPA is Pam's GPA so we can define a general function over here in our class and depending on the object that calls it it's gonna be giving or doing different things so the GPA is gonna be different depending on if Jim's calling it or if Pam is calling it and that's kind of why these are cool so you can make all sorts of these little functions and generally people will make these to get information about the object so for example figure out whether or not they have honors or modify values and in future tutorials we're gonna look at functions which are going to be modifying the values in our classes but hopefully that kind of gives you an idea of what you can do with these so you know in a lot of cases you're gonna want to have different functions inside of your classes that are gonna do stuff no I do want to just point out one more reason why these are cool so let's say that I have this program written and you know I'm using all these different students and maybe I have a program that like calculates who's on the honor roll or something well let's say that one day the Dean of the School comes to me and he's like hey Mike we're gonna change the qualification for honors so now instead of everybody with a 3.5 and greater is gonna have honors we're just gonna say everybody with a 2.0 and greater is gonna have honors in order for me to make that change in my program in other words in order for me to update that information all I have to do is go over here and change this to 2.0 and now all of the code in my program is still gonna work and these has honors are still gonna work but now the bar for having honors is going to be lowered so I could say student 1 dot has honors and now this is going to be true because we changed the qualification so we get a 1 and that's kind of why these are powerful you can kind of adjust different information and you know control different things about the overall class and about every instance of the class using these functions so hopefully that is clear hopefully you know you have an idea now of what you can do with these different objects functions

in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about getters and setters in C++ classes now getters and setters are extremely useful and basically they allow you to control the access to the different attributes and different elements inside of your C++ classes so I'm gonna show you guys the basics of using C++ in order to do that we're gonna use a little example so up here I have a class that I created and it's called movie and this is basically just like allowing us to represent a movie inside of our program so I have a few different attributes the movies gonna have a title it's gonna have a director it's also gonna have a rating so those are three different attributes of a movie right we can basically say like this is our movie this is what its gonna be that's what it's gonna have then down here we have a constructor so I'm just passing in the title of the director and then also the rating and then over here we're assigning those values to the values inside of the object this is all pretty standard stuff and if you've been following along with the course up to this point this should kind of make sense you know what I'm doing over here I'm essentially just defining a movie data type and down here I actually created a movie so I created a movie and it's called Avengers and the title is the Avengers director is Joss Whedon and the rating is pg-13 so I'm I'm creating an actual movie and you'll see down here I can print out the rating so why don't we run our program we'll just sort of get on the same level so over here I have pg-13 so it's printing out the rating everything works everything looks good now here's the thing a lot of times in C++ when we're creating something like a class up here like this movie we're gonna want to be able to control what information can be stored for a particular movie and let me give you an example so down here I have this rating as pg-13 right and generally for movies there's you know a certain number of ratings that you can have so it'd be like gee PG pg-13 R and then and our rights are not rated so just for our purposes let's say that these are all the ratings that you can give to a movie G PG pg-13 R and n are right I'm sure there's some more that we could think of but let's just say that those are the ratings that we're gonna say are valid for a movie those are the ratings that are gonna be allowed for a particular movie well over here I'm inserting pg-13 but let's say I wanted to instead enter in something else there's nothing stopping me from just entering in nonsense like dog but there's nothing that's stopping me from just typing in some nonsense rating there and then running the program and being able to store it inside of my movie right in other words I can set the rating equal to dog even though that's not technically like one of the official ratings that we can have and there's a lot of circumstances where there's gonna be things like this for example you know valid ratings that you're gonna want to enforce in other words like when you're writing this program you might not want in object you might not want a movie object to be created that's not using a valid rating like you wouldn't want this to be able to happen down here you wouldn't want them to be able to put a rating in as dog so I'm gonna show you guys how we can essentially just enforce that how we could make it so that the user can only create an object a movie object with a valid rating and to do that we can use something called getters and setters now the first thing that I'm gonna do after I turn that back is I'm gonna head up here into my class so up here in my movie class and I want to show you guys one thing you'll see up here I have this keyword public and essentially when I say public and I put all this stuff underneath public what that means is that all of this stuff is public and basically when something's public it means that any other program any other code can access it so essentially any code outside of this class is able to access the title of the movie the director the rating and the constructor so down here I'm able to print out Avengers dot rating because rating is public right so I can print this out because it's underneath this little public key word but there's another keyword that we can use in C++ which is called private and I can do the same thing as I did in public I can just say private and any attributes any variables any functions anything that I put underneath this private keyword is actually gonna be private so for example if I was to take this string rating and I was to put this under here under this private what this means is now only code inside of this movie class is able to access the rating attribute only code that's inside the movie can access the rating so if I was to come down here now and try to print out Avengers dot rating I'm not gonna be able to do that anymore you're gonna see that we're gonna get an error so you can see this highlights in red basically telling us that you can't print out Avengers dot rating because it's private so I no longer have access to the rating inside of my main function now one thing I will point out is I have access to the rating here in the constructor that's because the rating variable the rating attribute is in the same class as this constructor so it's able to access it but this main function isn't able to access it in any code inside the main function can't because it's not inside of that class so that's basically the difference between public and private and we can leverage public and private in order to control what ratings are able to get set for this movie so let me show you guys how we can do this the first thing I want to do is underneath this public block I'm gonna create a public function and I'm gonna call it set rating so actually this is gonna be void and I'm just gonna call it set rating and this is gonna take as a parameter it's gonna take one value it's gonna be a string a rating so this is gonna take a rating as a parameter down here inside of this set rating function I'm basically gonna say rating is equal to a rating so now whenever I want to give a value to the rating I'm gonna make it so we have to go through this set rating function so over here instead of saying rating is equal to a rating I'm set gonna say set rating and I'm gonna pass in a rating and so now whenever we set the rating it's gonna go through this set rating function and for example if I wanted to modify the rating down here so if I wanted to say like Avengers dot rating is equal to dog I'm not gonna be able to do this again because rating is private so I can't access it over here but if I want to modify the rating I can just go through this set rating function because it's public so over here if I wanted to modify the rating instead of saying Avenger stop rating I could say Avengers dot set rating and I could pass into this as a parameter dog all right so now anytime we're setting the rating either up here in the constructor or down here in the actual program we have to go through this set rating function and that's going to be really useful so essentially what we can do now is we can set up some rules so I can set up some rules inside of this set rating function for what ratings are going to be valid so I'm gonna go ahead and do that essentially what I'll do is I'll create an if statement and if the rating that gets passed in is one of the valid ratings like GE PG pg-13 R and R then we'll let them set it otherwise we'll be able to essentially like throw an error or we'll be able to say like hey this is an invalid rating so down here I'm just gonna create an if statement and I'm just gonna say if and I'm basically just gonna check to see if the rating is one of the valid ratings so we can check to see if a rating is equal to G or a rating is equal to PG and I can keep doing this for each of the valid ratings so I'll keep doing this over here and I'm just gonna say or a rating is equal to pg-13 or a rating is equal to R and then there's one more which is going to be or a rating is equal to NR so basically what I'm doing is I'm creating this long-winded if statement and it's checking all of these conditions so it's checking to see if a rating is G or if it's equal to PG or if it's equal to pg-13 or R or finally an R now if it's equal to one of those right if it's equal to one of those valid ratings then we can just go ahead and set it normally so I could say like rating is equal to a rating right because they entered in a valid rating so it's gonna be fine but here's the thing if they didn't enter in a valid rating that means that we're not gonna be able to set it as the rating that they entered so I could say house and otherwise why don't we just go ahead and set rating equal to NR so we'll say that if they entered in an invalid rating like if they tried to set an invalid rating for the rating for the movie we're just going to go ahead and set it to NR because they didn't enter in a valid rating so it's just gonna be not rated so here's the thing now whenever we want to set the rating we have to go through this set rating function so for example I can come over here and I could say Avengers set rating dog and then if I printed out the rating it's actually gonna say NR because they entered in an invalid rating it's just gonna default to NR but here's the other problem is when I can't actually print out the rating so I can't access Avengers dot rating because it's private remember so what we can do is we can create another function up here and this one is going to be a string so it's gonna return a string and I'm just gonna call it get rating and it's not gonna take any parameters it's just going to return rating so it'll just return the rating and so now if I wanted to print this out I could say Avengers get rating and I'll be able to print it out so let's go ahead and see what happens so down here I set Avengers rating equal to dog and that's an invalid rating so now when I get the rating and I print it out we should just print out NR and actually it looks like I have a typo here so I forgot to put it double equals and there let me see if I did that over here too nope okay so we should be able to run this now yeah so down here you'll see that we're printing out nr so I tried to set the rating you equal the dog that was an invalid rating so when I went to get it it's just giving me an R and that's gonna work for anything so for example over here when I just first created this I set pg-13 that's a valid rating right that is one of the official ratings that we can use so when I run this it's gonna have that it'll have a rating of pg-13 but if I tried to set this to like PG 15 or something that's not a valid rating right so when I run the program it's gonna basically say that it's not rated because we didn't enter in a valid rating and you know you could essentially do whatever you wanted there the point that I'm trying to make though is that there's gonna be certain times where you want to control what values or you know how the user can interact with the attributes of a class or of an object in our case we wanted to be able to restrict what types of ratings were able to be stored inside of a movie so I was able to set the attribute equal to private which meant nobody could access it directly they couldn't just say like hey the rating is equal to this or the rating is equal to that instead if they wanted to set a rating they had to go through this set rating function and they had to go through our little if statement here and that is an awesome way to control access to the individual elements or the individual attributes in a specific object

in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you guys about inheritance in C++ inheritance is basically where we can define a class and then we can define other classes and those classes can extend the functionality or they can inherit all the functionality all the attributes of that original class so the easiest way for me to explain this is just to kind of show you guys an example so over here in my program I created a class and it's called the chef class basically this class is like modeling like a chef in our program and there's a couple different functions that the chef class can perform the chef can make chicken the chef can make salad and the chef can make a special dish basically each of these functions just prints out like what it's doing so this one says the chef makes chicken the chef makes salad chef makes barbecue ribs very simple class and down here you'll see I'm actually creating an instance of this chef class and it's called chef and down here I'm telling the chef to make chicken so let's run the program and we'll see what happens so when I run the program you'll see it prints out the chef makes chicken awesome so we have this chef class and let's say that I'm running my program and I'm thinking to myself like hmm I think in addition to representing just a normal generic chef I also want to represent an Italian chef so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over and I'll actually just create another class so I'm just gonna say class and instead of creating in a chef class I'm gonna create an Italian chef class so I'll say Italian chef and let's say for our purposes when we're creating this Italian chef class we want the Italian chef to be able to do everything that the normal chef can do so this Italian chef can make chicken you can also make salad and can also make a special dish but in addition to that the Italian chef will be able to do a bunch of other stuff well we can actually use inheritance in order to build this Italian chef because the Italian chef is going to be able to do everything that the normal chef could do like make chicken make salad and make a special dish I can actually inherit all of these functions from the show class in my new Italian chef class I'll show you guys how to do that it's actually super easy all we have to do is come down here and I'm just gonna make it : and then I can just say public and chef and so this is referring to the class that I want to inherit from and now what's cool about this is this Italian chef is going to have access to all of the functionality up here in this chef class so it's basically going to inherit all of those functions so I'll show you if I was to come down here and create an Italian chef so if I just said Italian chef we'll just call it Italian chef I could then say Italian chef dot make chicken and even though I didn't specify anything up here even though this class is technically empty they even though I didn't specify a make chicken function or make salad or make special dish function up here I'm still able to call make chicken on Italian chef so if I was to run this program now you'll see it says this chef makes chicken so I'm able to call that function on the normal chef and the Italian chef essentially what's happening is the Italian chef down here is inheriting all of this functionality so actually just to sort of demonstrate this even further if I came down here and I changed this to chef makes yummy chicken now when I run my program again you'll see that the Italian chef is also going to be able to make yummy chicken so it's basically inheriting this function from the chef class and what's cool about inheritance is that not only can we inherit all that of functionality but we could extend on it so the Italian chef isn't just gonna be able to do everything the chef does the Italian chef can also do other stuff so the Italian chef could also like make pasta and down here we can just basically print out like the chef makes pasta so in addition to being able to make everything that the normal chef can make this Italian chef can also make pasta so I can come down here and say make pasta but it's important to note that this chef's can't make pasta so if I tried to call top make pasta on the normal chef you'll see we're gonna get an error so you'll see over here it's not gonna be able to run the program and actually looks like I had an error up here so this should be a less than sign all right so now we'll get an error down by the other chef yeah so now we're getting this error which is basically saying this chef can't make pasta but the chef could make chicken and now that you'll see the Italian chef is gonna make pasta and the normal chefs gonna make chicken and actually one more thing I forgot we need to put public over here keep forgetting to do that so I'm gonna say public and then this is basically gonna specify that this function is gonna be public so now we should be able to run our program and you'll see it says the chef makes yummy chicken and the chef makes pasta so both of our chefs are able to do different things and that's pretty cool and the other cool thing I can do with inheritance is I can actually override certain functions so you'll notice up here the normal chef has this make special dish function and this chef is making barbecue ribs as a special dish but let's say that the Italian chef was gonna have a different special dish well I can do something called overriding a function so I can actually copy this function from up here and I can paste it down here into my Italian chef and essentially now this is gonna override the function from up here so instead of making barbecue ribs we could have him make like chicken parm so now this Italian chef is gonna be making chicken parm while the normal chef will make barbecue ribs so if I came down here and I said make special dish on the normal chef and I said make special dish on the Italian chef now these are gonna be two different things because the Italian chef overrode that original function so chef makes chicken parm and the chef makes barbecue ribs so that's kind of how overriding can be useful like if you're inheriting a function and you want to change like what it's doing or modify what it's doing in the other class you can do that now here's a quick terminology so we would call this chef class a superclass and then we would call this Italian chef class a subclass because the Italian chef is inheriting from the chef class which is the superclass and that is essentially the basics of inheritance is you're essentially creating a class and you're inheriting all the functionality from another class inside of it and then you can do things like add extra functions you can add on to it or you can override the functions that you inherit.
