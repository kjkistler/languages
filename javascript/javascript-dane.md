# JavaScript


in this course I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know to get started using JavaScript

javascript is a programming language that's used on the Internet so just about every modern website that you're gonna go on is gonna use JavaScript in some way shape or form

and what JavaScript does really well is it allows you to make your websites more responsive so a user can come on your website they can click around they can do different things and your website will respond to them so your website can do certain things when they do certain things your website can give them things like pop-ups or I can do things when they click different buttons

javascript allows you to basically go into your HTML and access each element do certain things dynamically basically 

javascript is a powerhouse language that you can use on the Internet to seriously up the game of your HTML CSS files now in order to follow along with this course you're gonna need to know the basics of HTML and CSS and if you're liking draft Academy you're in luck because we have a course specifically designed for HTML and a course design for CSS so if you don't know anything about HTML or CSS head over to those courses first and then come back here and I'll teach you some awesome JavaScript there's seriously some awesome stuff we can do with JavaScript you can build little games you could build things like a multiple-choice quiz you can get input from a user so you know a user could enter in their name you could build like a little chat app and I'm gonna show you ways that you can do all of that stuff in this course so we'll start the course by just going over some basics we're gonna learn how to get JavaScript set up how can you write your JavaScript how do you include JavaScript with your HTML and then we're going to talk about some of the cool features of JavaScript I'm gonna show you guys how you can go in and modify the HTML I'll show you how you can get input from users we'll build little games and little widgets it's gonna be a really fun time I hope you stick around for the course and learn a little bit about JavaScript 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about selecting a JavaScript text editor now a JavaScript text editor is basically just a program that you can use to write your JavaScript files so anytime that we're working with the JavaScript you can either write JavaScript inside of an HTML file so inside of an HTML file you can use these special script tags and you can write JavaScript or you can create your own separate JavaScript files and write the JavaScript in there so any text editor that would be used for like HTML or CSS can also be used for JavaScript so if you're somebody who has done HTML and CSS in the past and you already have a text editor that you'd like to use then you can actually just go ahead and use that for JavaScript as well but if you're new to sort of web development you're just kind of looking to learn JavaScript I'm gonna talk to you about the different options you have for text editors when it comes to JavaScript it's actually really easy any text editor that will let you write out text and save a file in a JavaScript format or an HTML format is gonna be able to be used for JavaScript so you know you can use the simplest of text editor like notepad on windows or TextEdit on Mac or you can download a text editor that's specially designed for programming on the web or JavaScript programming now you don't need to install any you know special programs or special dependencies to run and use JavaScript all you have to do is just write out the JavaScript in your text editor and your browser will know what to do with it so like I said the first type of text editor that you can use would just be a very simple text editor on Windows something like notepad on Mac TextEdit these are very simple programs you can see down here I have TextEdit open because I'm on a Mac and I just have some simple JavaScript typed out so this is like a JavaScript file and I have all my JavaScript in here and you could basically open this up in the browser and it would be able to run and and everything would work so you need something really simple like this and you can just write out your JavaScript save the file as a dot J's file and import it into like an HTML file and you able to use it or you can use a text editor that's specially designed for HTML CSS and JavaScript and there's a lot of text editors out there that are like that a couple there's one called atom sublime text regular notepad plus plus there's a bunch of different programs out there that will take something like this and style it a little bit better and make it a little bit easier to read and write I have one here it's called Adam and you can see the difference so over here in this atom program the text is all styled so obviously you're not going to understand what any of this javascript is doing but this is the same code as this over here it's just over here that's a lot easier to read and visualize right certain words are highlighted in certain colors and you can see stuff that's inside of these quotation marks is green so there's like a color scheme or what you would call like a theme that's associated with this text and a lot of programmers will find that a lot easier to use than just something like this also a text editor like this could auto complete for me so I can start typing out a JavaScript command like this and you can see that this text editor is automatically giving me suggestions on what I should type next so something like this can be really useful when you're writing JavaScript here's what I would recommend if you're just starting out with JavaScript and maybe you're just starting out with like web development in general I would urge you to use something more like this something simpler right if you're just using like TextEdit or notepad there's really not a whole lot that can go wrong you basically just write out everything inside of here there's nothing to configure there's no themes to figure out there's no plugins it's basically just like what you see is what you get and when you're first learning the simpler the better so sticking with something like this something simple is probably gonna help you just to sort of understand the fundamentals and then once you understand the basics you can move up to something like this which is obviously like a little bit easier to use and visualize and see but it's also a little bit more complex because there's all you know there's all these different things you have to configure and you know that certain things might go wrong so that's just sort of my recommendation beginners but for the most part just know that there's two basic types you can have a simple text editor like this or you can have something a little bit more complex like this and if you want to find a text editor like this like I said there's a couple popular ones atom sublime Visual Studio code I think it's called Tech's regular notepad plus plus basically you just do a Google search for you know JavaScript text editors or web development text editors and you'll be able to find a bunch and what you should do is just try out a couple to see which ones you like see which ones you don't like and then find one that's gonna work for you so yeah that's the basics of picking a text editor for JavaScript like I said you know Jobs was very simple so anything that you pick should pretty much work as long as it can save files 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about writing some basic JavaScript so I'm gonna show you where you can write your JavaScript how to set up JavaScript and then some basic JavaScript commands that we can use just to sort of get our feet wet javascript is a programming language that was designed to be used on the web so generally on the web you're using a language called HTML and you can also use another language called CSS and those two languages are really good at sort of helping you to display your content but you can use a language like JavaScript was sort of ups the power of your website so JavaScript can do all sorts of cool things that will make your websites more powerful and you can use javascript to add in some awesome features to your website so let's get started over here I have this index.html file and whenever we're writing JavaScript you can either write your JavaScript directly inside of an HTML file or you can create a separate javascript file and link up the HTML file to the JavaScript file in this video and just to start we're gonna be writing the JavaScript inside of HTML so this is just a very basic HTML document that I have set up and I also have it over here in the browser so any code that goes in here is it gonna show up here on the browser and I can put my JavaScript tags inside of this HTML so HTML has all of these tags like we have these head tags these body tags and we can use another type of tag which is called a script tag and a script tag just looks exactly how you think it would look so it's just script and we're also gonna need a closing tag so we can just say script and we want to put something in here so we're gonna say type is equal to text forward slash JavaScript and basically what this is gonna do is it's gonna tell the web browser that we have JavaScript inside of these tags so now inside these tags were no longer writing HTML now we're just writing JavaScript so if you notice up here like these tags are all highlighted because they're HTML tags but if I was to put one of these tags here inside of these script tags you'll notice that it doesn't get highlighted and that's because we're no longer writing HTML inside of these script tags we're writing JavaScript so any JavaScript we want to write for this HTML file is gonna go inside of here now one of the most basic things that you can do with JavaScript is write something out to the screen so here we have this HTML document and we don't really have any HTML text or anything that's going up here but I can actually use JavaScript to write content onto the screen so I can use something called a document dot write and then I can use to open and close parenthesis and then I can use a semicolon and this is a basic JavaScript statement which basically says I want to go to the HTML document and I want to write something so over here inside of these parentheses we can tell this write function what we want to write so I can basically make two quotation marks and whenever we're working with text inside of JavaScript generally we're gonna put it inside of quotation marks just like this and so now I can write something out to the screen and generally when you're learning a programming language the first thing that everybody learns is how to do a hello world so we can write out hello world and I'll save this and what this is gonna do is it's gonna write hello world out here on this HTML document so I'll refresh my page and you can see that hello world shows up just like that and that's sort of the basics of like setting up JavaScript and writing something so I could actually change something that was in here I could say hello Mike and that I would update here on the screen and you could also do another one so I could put like a space here and I could do another document dot write and we can type something else so instead of saying hello Mike I could say this is a tutorial and that should show up right next to it so now we have this whole sentence as showing up so I can use this document dot write command to write something out onto the screen and that's really just the basics right so we learned how to set up JavaScript using these script tags we learn how to write something out onto the screen there's one more thing I want to show you guys just in this basic lesson which is comments and a comment is basically a special piece of text that doesn't get rendered by the browser so the browser goes through this document and it looks and it sees all these different commands and when it sees document outright it knows that we should write out hello Mike or whatever on to the web browser but when you use a comment a comment is basically just a piece of text that is used for us humans so it's not used by the computer it's used by us and there's two ways that you can create comments in JavaScript the first way is using a two forward slashes just like this and you'll see that my text editor has changed the color of this code and if I was to take this comment and put it in front of this document dot write command you'll see that hello Mike is no longer gonna get written out onto the screen because it's commented out and anything that's commented out is just gonna get ignored by the browser so you can use comments to comment something out like that so if you have a line of code and you sort of want to get rid of it temporarily without deleting it you can just put a comment in front of it you can also use comments to write little messages in your code so I can do a comment and I can write like this writes text to the screen so I could write a little message and then if I came back later or if somebody else looked at this they could see okay this is writing text to the screen so you can write a comment and when you use these two forward slashes it makes the comment on a single line so if I was to make a new line you'll see that this line is no longer commented out but if you wanted to make a comment that spans multiple lines you can use a forward slash and a star and then you also need to end this off with a forward slash or with sorry with a star and a forward slash so now anything inside of these star forward slash tags is gonna get rendered as a comment so those are two ways that you can use comments to basically like write text that's not gonna get seen by the browser so yeah again these are just the basics and if all this stuff isn't clear yet just stick with it you know JavaScript can be a little bit intimidating at first but it's actually really easy and I'm gonna walk you guys through everything you need to know but for now all you need to know is that you can use this document dot write command and you can put some text inside of these parentheses and it'll show up over here on the screen 



In this tutorial I want to talk to you about using an external javascript file so the easiest way for you to write JavaScript with your HTML is just to include it in your HTML file using script tags so over here I just have this file index.html and down here I have these two script tags and basically this code inside of those tags is JavaScript it's valid JavaScript and I'm using this document dot write command in order to print out hello world onto the document on to the HTML page you can see that's over here but in addition to writing your JavaScript inside of these script tags you can also write your JavaScript inside of its own JavaScript file and then you can link up that javascript file with your HTML file and you can write the JavaScript in one file you can keep it all organized and then you can keep your HTML all organized and they'll both work together so I'm going to show you how to create an external javascript file and wire it up with your HTML file over here I have my little website folder I'm just gonna create a new file inside of here and I'm just gonna call this script dot j s now you can name this whatever you want the one thing you do need though is this dot J s extension that stands for JavaScript so I'm gonna create this script J's file and now we have a valid JavaScript file so in here I could write any JavaScript code that I wanted and then I'll link it up to my HTML file and we'll see how it works so I'm gonna use that same document dot write command and over here I'm just gonna say script J s so we'll basically just print out the name of the file that we're in so over here in this index dot HTML what I need to do is I need to tell this file that we want to use that script dot J's file so I'm actually just gonna get rid of these script tags or I'll comment them out for the time being so these are no longer gonna work and I'm gonna come up here into the head of my document and in here I'm gonna make another script tag so it's just gonna be script and I want to pass this in attribute so I want to give this script tag some information and we're gonna give it a source attribute and basically we're gonna tell this script tag to go out and grab that javascript file that we just wrote so it was called script J s and inside of these quotation marks you just want to write the relative path to the JavaScript file so in my case script j s index.html which is this file are in the same directory so i can just refer to this as script j s so we'll close off this tag and then we're also gonna need an ending tag so now what should happen is this script tag is gonna go grab this script j s and we'll be able to use all the javascript that's inside of this file in this HTML file so when i refresh the page you'll see that we get script dot j s showing up here so now we've wired up this javascript file with this HTML file so i could come over here and put an alert and this will basically just alert a message out onto the screen and we can say the file is working because this file is now hooked up and you can see here we get this alert that tells us that so that's how you can use a external javascript file now one of the benefits of using an external javascript file is that you can include this javascript inside of multiple HTML files so I'm just gonna real quick make another HTML file we'll just call this page two dot HTML and I'll give this a basic HTML layout and in here I'm going to include that same JavaScript file so inside of page two I'm also including this script tag and so now if I come over to my browser and I go to page two you'll see that we get this same exact code so I'm here on page two and it's able to use that same exact JavaScript that we in that index dot HTML file and that's one of the cool things about storing our JavaScript in these external files if I had just stored my JavaScript down here in these script tags I wouldn't have been able to use that same code in another file I'd have to physically copy it and paste it but if I use an external file then I can just write the code in one spot and use it in multiple HTML files now using the script tags and using the external javascript file are you know they're doing the same thing functionally and so you know one isn't necessarily better than the other they're just used in different scenarios going forward in the course we're gonna be using an external javascript file just because it's a little bit cleaner and it's a little bit easier to kind of see without all that HTML cluttered up 




in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using javascript to write HTML so one of the cool things about javascript is you can actually write valid HTML entirely from your JavaScript and then it'll show up on your HTML pages so over here I have this script J's file and I also have this index.html file over here and these two files are wired up they're connected so you can see over here I have these script tags inside of the head of my document and they're just linking to that script up j/s file so over here in this script J's file I can actually write HTML that will show up on my HTML page and you can do that entirely from JavaScript we do that using a command called document and when we talk about a document like this it basically refers to the HTML document that this is getting linked to and then we can say dot and write and what this will do is it'll basically allow us to write HTML to the document so inside of these parentheses whatever I put in here will get written out to the HTML document so I'm gonna put just two quotation marks and I can just write some text in here so we can just write anything and now this is actually gonna show up inside of our HTML document so you can see that it shows up up here on top of all this other stuff but what's cool about this document right command is I could write actual HTML inside of here so if I wanted I could put like a header to inside here and we can say JavaScript rules and I'll go ahead and end off that h2 so this is a valid line of HTML code but I'm writing it inside of a JavaScript file and you'll see over here it shows up so this is a header - if I was to inspect this element you'll see down here we have a pet or two with JavaScript rules inside of it and really you can write any HTML that you want so I could write one line here if I wanted I could make another line and we could put something like a horizontal rule and it'll show up over you so you could write an entire HTML document just from your JavaScript using these document dot write commands and I want to show you guys how you can actually control this so you'll notice here the JavaScript that I'm writing is showing up right on top of this existing HTML so if we look inside this index dot HTML file you'll notice that we have a header one down here we also have this paragraph and the javascript rules and the horizontal rule those are showing up on top of this stuff and that's because we put this script tag inside of the head of our document so you'll notice that the script tag is up here and it's on top of the h1 and the paragraph if I wanted I can move this script tag and that will control where this Java there'd where this HTML that gets generated inside that script tag shows up so if I wanted I could put it right here in between this header one in this paragraph and I'll just paste that right in there so it's in between them and now you'll see that this JavaScript rules and the horizontal rule when I save the file show up in between so we have JavaScript tutorial and this is the code that we generated using the JavaScript and then we have the paragraph down here and if I wanted I could put this below both of those elements as well so now it's gonna be below both of them so you can control where the JavaScript generated HTML shows up by controlling where you put these script tags and if I want it I can do anything from inside of here so I can even add some styling onto one of these elements style is equal to and whenever you're using HTML inside of these parentheses you always inside of these quotation marks you always want to make sure you use single quotation marks and the reason is because if you use like one quotation mark you see it'll end the actual string so we you don't want to do that what you want to do is use single quotation marks and then we could write whatever style under the one so we could say like color blue and now this header two will be colored blue and we did all of that just from our JavaScript so this is a really powerful way to use JavaScript and this is kind of like a good first lesson in JavaScript which is you know that JavaScript and HTML work really well together like JavaScript was designed to work with HTML and that's why you can literally write entire HTML documents from inside your JavaScript so I really want to drive home that point as we start with this javascript course which is that you know JavaScript is tightly coupled with HTML so that's the basics of using this document dot write command this is a really powerful command and you're definitely gonna want to practice using it you know practice just putting a little HTML tags inside of here and seeing how they display it on the document 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about variables in JavaScript a variable is basically just a special container that we can use inside of JavaScript to store specific values we can store data inside of these little containers and you'll see in a second that using a variable is a great way to keep track of your data and organize the data that you're using inside of your JavaScript programs so I'm gonna show you guys how you can create a variable now if you want to create a variable remember a variable is just storing a specific value so I can use a keyword var and when I use this var word this is a special word inside of JavaScript so when you type out this word var javascript knows that okay this person is trying to create a variable the first thing we need to do once we type out var is give this variable a name so generally a variable is like a container and we want to give that container a specific name so we can identify and so we know what it's holding so I'll type of var and I'm just gonna create a variable called phrase so this will store like a specific phrase and in here I can pass a value so I'm gonna use this equal sign and in my case I'm gonna be passing some text so generally we would call this a string it's just like a string of characters or basically just any text that you would write out so my phrase is gonna be to be or not to be and whatever we're writing a javascript lime we at the end when we're done we want to put a semicolon and this just tells JavaScript that okay we're done creating our variable or done with this specific command so now this phrase variable actually contains the value to be or not to be this is a string variable so it's storing a string which is this text over here so if I was to come down to this document dot write command inside of here I can pass this phrase and now what this will do is it will print out to be or not to be in other words it'll print out the value that's stored inside of this phrase variable to the screen so over here when i refresh the page you'll see that it prints out to be or not to be so if I was to change this to be in not to be now that would modify on the screen so I could just modify this variable up here and it'll change down here one of the cool things about a variable is that I can use it in multiple places so if I wanted I could print this out like a bunch of different times so I can print this out five times right just like that and I'll print it out to the screen you'll see that it's getting printed out five times but if I wanted I could actually change this variable so normally if I was just like putting regular text inside of here if I wasn't referring to this variable I would have to go through to each one of these document write commands and change the text but because we're using a variable if I wanted to change this all I would have to do would be change it up here so instead of typing out to be or not to be I could just type out like my name so we could type out like so now it'll print out Mike a bunch of times and I was able to change what got printed out by just changing this up here in one place and that's one of the benefits of using variables is that you can define a value and store it inside of a container and then when you want to change that value you only have to change it in one spot so if I was using this phrase variable like a hundred different times in my JavaScript file and I wanted to change it I could just change it up here and it would automatically update in all those 100 places another thing you can do with variables is you can modify them so I could come down here and let's say after this second document dot write I wanted to change the value of the variable well I can actually assign it a different value so I could say phrase is equal to and now I can give it a different value so instead of saying my name I could say like a fruit so I could say like Apple and what you'll see is halfway through this variable is going to change values so for these first two document rights it's printing out my and then it's printing out Mike again but I then changed the phrase I changed the value of the variable to Apple and so now over here it's printing out Apple three times so you can actually do this as much as you want right down here I could change the phrase again and we could change it to orange so a different fruit and now you'll see that this will get updated on the web browser so it's Mike Mike and then I change the value of the variables so it's Apple Apple and then I change it again and so now it's orange so that's kind of like the basics of working with variables and then like I said you can modify those variables throughout your javascript file and that'll change what their value is so up here we're defining a string right so I have this variable called phrase and I'm giving it a string in this case it's a string with my name there's actually a bunch of other types of variables that we can create and there's actually a bunch of different types of data inside of JavaScript so I would refer to this over here as a particular data type and in our case this is the string data type so the type of data that this phrase variable is holding is a text string but we can also store other things for example I can store like a number so if I said their age is equal to 23 now inside of this age variable I'm storing a number I'm storing a 23 so because this isn't inside of these quotation marks and because I'm using numbers this is storing a number I can also use like decimal numbers so I could have another one like GPA and I get set as you go to like 3.1 or something so instead of just putting a whole number I'm using a number with a decimal after it and JavaScript actually doesn't care if you use decimals or not so I can make this 23.0 and it doesn't matter to JavaScript like JavaScript deals with like whole numbers like this and decimal numbers like this the same way and if you've ever used another programming language sometimes they give a hassle like if you using decimal numbers versus whole numbers but JavaScript doesn't about that another type of variable we can use is a true/false variable so a lot of times you're gonna want to store true or false data and we would call this a boolean data type so I can make a variable and we'll call it like ismael and we give this a value of true or false so a boolean variable can only have two possible values either true or false so in my case I am a male so I could say true but if I wasn't a male then I could say false and so this variable is now representing the value of you know whether or not I'm a male and that brings me to another point which is when you're creating these variables you want to make sure that you use descriptive names a lot of times in programming you'll see people who make variables it'll just be like their a is equal to 23 but when I make a very variable called ver a that doesn't give me any information right it's just a letter and sometimes people will do this to like save space or they're just too lazy to write something out but generally when you're creating a variable you want to give it a descriptive name here's a good example imagine you are like moving out of your house right and you're packing up everything into boxes the best way to do it would be to write on the outside of those boxes like what's inside the boxes right so you can say like this box has this this this and this inside of it so that way when you get to the new house it's really easy to figure out where everything has to go because you vallei below the boxes really well that's the idea with the variable these are containers we're storing the values inside of these containers so we want to give them good names so that we can access them later so these are the core data types in JavaScript we have strings we have numbers just like this and we also have boolean values and I also want to point out with strings in addition to using double quotes you could also use single quotes like this javascript doesn't care if you use double or single quotes different developers will have different preferences but javascript will deal with single and double quotes the same way but in addition to these basically three core datatypes there's also two other data types that you encounter when you're using javascript and the first is called null so if I made a variable maybe we could call like flaws I could give this a value of null and basically what no means is that this variable has no value so we're like going out of our way to specify that this variable is gonna have no value whatsoever and you're gonna see sometimes in JavaScript variables will be no there's another data type which would be like we could put like description here whatever and this is called undefined and so sometimes in JavaScript you'll encounter variables that are undefined and basically what this means is that the variable doesn't have a value yet so basically it means that we haven't given this variable of value and undefined is different from no cuz when you define a variable as null you're giving it a definition like you're defining the variable you'll see you're saying like this variable has no value undefined doesn't mean that it has no value it just means that it hasn't been defined yet so it's like it's open to the possibility of like having a value it's really just like hasn't been touched yet so it hasn't been defined yet so that's kind of the difference between these two you're probably not gonna be like using these too much but you will see them when you're working with your JavaScript code but like I said for the most part if you're making variables you're gonna be using either strings numbers or blue Lian's that's kind of like the core data types in JavaScript 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about working with strings in JavaScript now a lot of times when you're using JavaScript you're gonna want to work with text and text can be encoded inside of these literal strings and then we can use them we can store them in variables and we can do different things with them we can modify them we can find out information about them so I want to show you guys how to work with strings inside of JavaScript the most basic string is just two quotation marks and text inside of it and over here I have this document dot write command and inside I'm passing this string right so it's just text inside of quotation marks and with strings you can also use a single quotation mark so instead of just a double one you can use a single one it doesn't really matter JavaScript doesn't really care and you can see that this is getting printed out over here on the screen and strings are really great a lot of times you're gonna want to store information inside of a string form in addition to just placing a string over here I could also place this inside of a variable so I'm gonna create a variable up here and we'll just say their phrase is equal to and now I'm just gonna put in that string so this is a way that we can store a string value inside of a variable so now if we want to access this string we can just access this variable called phrase so if I want to print this out I could just put phrase there in that document out write command and it's gonna stay the same right because we're printing out this same thing and if I want to access some information about the string I can just say dot and then I can type in like the type of information I want to access and string has one value we can access which is called length so if I just say phrase which is the name of the string variable dot length this is gonna tell me how many characters are inside of this string so this should print out 16 because this string has 16 characters inside of it if I was to like change the length of the string then the length is gonna be modified as well so using the length of a string it can be really useful in JavaScript there's a lot of circumstances where you know figure out like how long a particular string is in addition to accessing the length we can also use things called methods on strings and a method is essentially like a little snippet of code that we can call which will perform certain operations on our strings and there's a bunch of these different methods and they'll do different things for us they'll either like modify our string or they'll give us specific information about our string and methods are really cool and there's a bunch of these different methods that we can use with strings and the way we access a method is similar to accessing this length attribute we can say dot and then I want to type in the name of the method that I want to access and one of the most basic methods inside of JavaScript for Strings is converting a string to upper or lower case so we can say basically just type out the name of the method we want to access and there's one called to uppercase and when I'm using a method I want to use these open and close parentheses after so I'm typing out this dot the name of the method that I want to use in our case to uppercase and then these open and close parentheses so what will happen now is this string will get printed out but instead of just printing out normally it'll print out uppercase so now you see it's entirely uppercase and that's because this method is basically taking the string it's taking this phrase string it's converting it to uppercase and then that whole thing is getting printed out I can also use a lower case so we could say two lower case and that's going to do exactly the thing it's gonna convert everything to lowercase but with these methods you can also give them a specific information so you can give these methods information and then with that information they can give you different things where they can do different things so there's another method here called char @ and basically what this will do is we can pass this a number so we can put inside of these parentheses a number and a lot of times people will call this a parameter so you'll say we can pass this method a parameter basically we're just giving it some information so we can give this char at method a number and basically what it'll do it'll is it'll return the character at that specific index in the string so if I was to give this a 1 you might think that that will give us the character at the first position and the string so if I say this you're probably thinking ok this will give us this s but actually what it's gonna do is it's gonna give us a T if I was to give this a 2 you might think well 2 should give us the T right because it's 1 2 but actually this is gonna give us that R so this is returning a character at a specific index but it seems to be returning the wrong character and this kind of brings us to a core concept with strings in JavaScript which is indexes and down here I have this little index chart here and I want to show you guys this I'm just gonna uncomment this really quick when we're dealing with strings in JavaScript and specifically when we're dealing with the indexes of those strings javascript starts counting the letters of the string from 0 so if I was to ask you like count out the letters inside of this string you might say well here's 1 2 3 4 but when javascript indexes a string when javascript counts out the characters in a string it starts with 0 so it says 0 1 2 3 4 so if i'm using javascript and I asked JavaScript to give me the first character and the string instead of giving me this a it's gonna give me this one if I ask JavaScript to give me the zeroth character in the string it's gonna give me B a so that's kind of like a little bit of the idiosyncrasy with JavaScript and it's actually the same with most programming languages as they start their indexes from 0 so they start counting from 0 so that's just something to keep in mind when you're using your JavaScript so we can actually come back over to this char at and now you'll know like what index you need to pass so if I pass a 0 into here now I should return the S right if I pass a 3 into here it's gonna give me 0 1 2 3 it's gonna give me this I so that's how you can use that character app function in order to get specific characters out specific indexes you can also use another method which is kind of like the opposite of this so I could say index of and now instead of passing this a number I want to pass this a letter and what this will do is it'll tell me the index of that letter inside of this string so if I pass this in s actually we make it a capital S this should return 0 because s is at the 0th location in the string if I pass this in R this should return 0 1 2 it should return 2 because R is it the second index that's exactly what it does so you can use this index of method to figure out where specific characters are inside of your string and what this will do is it'll give you the index of the first one so for example I have two O's up here in the word cool this is gonna give me the index of this first o and you can see it's 13 there's also another method which is similar but it's last index of so this should return the last index of something so this will return instead of 13 or return 14 so we return the last index of a given thing and if in here if you pass a character that's not in the string so for example if I pass this as e this is gonna give me a negative 1 so it'll give you a negative 1 if the character isn't in the current string so that's the basics of indexes with strings and then also using that char at and that index of function those are gonna be really useful when you're writing your JavaScript and working with strings there's also another really cool method which is called substring and this is a method which is you can just type it out like this a substring and instead of just taking one input instead of taking one parameter this is actually going to take two parameters and the first parameter is gonna be a number and this is going to be the index that we want to start at so substring is basically going to take a section of your string so like one part of the string and print it out and we can define which part of the string we want substring to print out the first thing is going to be this starting index so where do we want to start grabbing this string so I can say zero and this will just start grabbing the string here and then I can pass this another parameter and to do that I'm just going to type a comma and now I can put in the other parameter that I want to pass in and this is going to be the index where we want to stop grabbing the string so if I said for example three this will grab the string from zero up to three and it's actually not going to include this third index so substring is gonna grab zero one two and it's gonna stop when it gets to three so it's not gonna grab this I it's just gonna grab STR so over here you'll see we are just having STR so I could change this if I wanted I can start this at like four and I can grab all the way up to nine but again not including the ninth character and it'll you know grab all of that so you can use something to grab a specific part of a string and you can also use these methods together so if I wanted inside of this substring method I could actually pass it the result of another method so what I can say is let's say that I wanted to grab this cool word right here right so I want it to grab only this word from the string what I could do is I can pass in instead of just passing in numbers I could pass in the results of other methods so I could say here we want to start grabbing this at this C character so what I could say is I could say phrase dot index of see and remember phrase that index of C is going to return the location of the first C in the string which is this see inside of cool and then over here I want to grab this all the way up till the end of the string so I can say phrase dot length and now what this will do is it'll grab the string from C all the way to the end of the string and so you'll see here now we just get this word cool and so you can use that with a bunch of these different things so if I wanted to grab for example our cool instead of just cool I can come over here and change this from a C to an A and now it'll grab our cool so you can use these methods inside of other methods like I can pass the result of a particular method into another method as a parameter and you can do cool things like that there's also another really cool method which I want to show you guys and it's called ends with so this is an example where a method will give us a boolean value so I can say phrase dot ends with and in here I can just pass a string and so what I could do is this will I can give this a value and it'll tell me whether or not the string ends with that value so if I was to type in here cool this is gonna return true so we're gonna get a value of true back because the string ends with cool but if I returned cools like that this should give us false because the string doesn't end with that there's also another one which is similar to this which is includes and basically we're doing the same thing so I can pass in a string and it'll tell me if that string is inside of phrase so I could say like strings and this should return true so I could also include like another variable so if I made a variable here and we'll just call it text and I set it equal to our cool what I could do that as I can pass in this text variable as a parameter so I could say text and this should return true because our cool is included in this string so you can you know you can really like mix and match these different things but really the core concept is that we're using a method which we use by dot and then the name of the method on this string we can pass this method specific information and using that information it'll be able to give us specific values back so it'll be able to return to us different information or different values in this case it's returning a true or a false value in other cases it returns a number in other cases it just returns another string so these can be really flexible another thing I want to show you guys is how you can concatenate strings and concatenation is basically the process of taking a string and appending another string onto it and this is really simple so what I could do is I could take this phrase and I could combine it with text and I can do that with a plus sign so I can say phrase + text and JavaScript will know that we want to concatenate these two strings together so you'll see now over here we just get these two strings together and you'll see like this is looking a little weird because there's not a space here so if I added a space here then this will look a little bit better another thing I can do is just put in actual text so if I got rid of this space instead I could add in another string into here so I can just put an actual space and now we'll have that same space over here so you can combine variables with like strings using this plus sign and obviously you need a plus sign on either side of the string so I want to point you guys to a resource this is w3schools com and if you just type in JavaScript string reference w3schools into Google this will pop up and this is a page that has basically just a listing of all of the methods that you can use with these strings so you can see a couple of these we used in this lesson but there's a bunch of them here so what you want to do is just really practice playing around with these strings and you can do exactly what I did which is just you know practice printing out different strings and using different methods and you can get a listing of them from this website or there's also a bunch of other websites that will list them out so that's the basics of strings I hope you guys learn something I hope you're able to leverage strings inside of your JavaScript 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about working with numbers in JavaScript numbers are extremely important in any programming language and a lot of times especially in JavaScript you're gonna want to be using numbers storing them doing math with different numbers so I'm gonna show you how you can do things like that most basic form of a number is just typing out the number like this so here I'm using this document dot write command and I'm just having it print out this number in addition to just having a solid whole number like this you can also use numbers with decimals so I could say like 3.2 4 or 5 and it's still gonna work so javascript doesn't really care which type of number used in certain programming languages they separate like whole integer numbers and decimal numbers but javascript doesn't do that so you can pretty much write out you could write 2 or you could write 2.0 it's all the same to JavaScript you can also do basic arithmetic with numbers so I could say 2 plus 2 and JavaScript will recognize that we're trying to use a mathematical operation here and it'll actually do the calculation and print it out so you can see we get 4 in addition to addition you can also use subtraction division using the forward slash and multiplication using the asterisks just like that and if you want you can also group different numbers and mathematical equations using parentheses so you can control things like order of operations so if I was to say like 2 plus 7 this will do the multiplication first and then it'll add so it'll be 4 plus 7 so we'll get 11 but if I wanted I could do the opposite so I could put parentheses around these guys and now it'll execute this first so we'll get 9 times 2 we should get 18 so using parentheses you can control like the order of operations and how these get calculated you can also store these things inside of variables so if I wanted I can create a variable over here and we'll just call it number and I can set this equal to you know a specific number so we could say this is 6 and then I could actually use this inside of my mathematical equation so I could say number times 2 plus 7 so this will now be 6 times 9 so we fifty-four and you know you can mix and match you can use all sorts of different variables and you can do different things with different variables there's also a couple other operators that we could use so if I wanted I could just get other information so for example if I used three and then I said this % what this is is called the modulus operator so this will actually divide these numbers and then it'll give me the remainder so 3 divided by 2 is gonna be 1 with a remainder of 1 and so this is just gonna return 1 if I made this a 11 that should just be again 1 because we have a remainder of 1 so that's sort of the basic operators that you can use as far as like arithmetic goes with JavaScript there's also a bunch of math methods that we can use so there's a lot of like mathematical operations that you're gonna want to do if you know you're working with these numbers and you can use special methods to do them and a method is basically just like a little snippet of code that you can run and the method will perform specific operations for you and we can actually pass these methods different information so let's just work with this number down here and I'm just gonna make this 2 so we can use specific methods and I want to show you guys just some common methods that you're gonna use the first one is absolute value so if I had a negative 2 up here I can actually use this absolute value method so I want to say math and every time you're using a math method you say math dot abs so this is the name of the function or the name of the method and then inside of parentheses I can pass this a value so I'm going to pass it this number variable that we created up here what this will do is it'll just return the absolute value of the number so we should just get 2 so you know if this is negative or positive it just returns like the absolute value you can also use other methods so this one is called max and in here you can pass two numbers so I could give this two numbers and it'll spit out the maximum so I could say number and I could say 4 and so what this should do is it will print out whichever number is bigger and in our case this is negative 2 so it should print out 4 and I could use another method called min which do the opposite it will print out the minimum so now it will print out negative two you can also round a number so if I had a let's say that instead of a negative two this was like a two point four I can use the round function so I can save math dot round and we're just gonna give this one parameter which is gonna be number and this will round this number according to standard rounding rules so if it's point four or lower or round down if it's point five or higher it'll round up so just like that so round obviously it can be pretty useful you'd also use another method called powa and this is like power so i can pass a specific number into here and then i could pass in which power i wanted to take that to so i can say number and we'll take it to the third power so this will just be 2 raised to the third power and you'll see here that we get eight because two cubed is gonna be eight and you can do the opposite so I could say square root and then I could pass in a number like for example 36 and now this will give me the square root of 36 so we'll get six there's one more method I want to show you guys which is can be pretty useful and it's the random method and this random method will basically return a random number between 0 and 1 so it will return like a decimal number so you can see like over here as i refresh the page is returning all of these different random numbers and it's returning these numbers in decimal format so basically you can get whatever numbers you want from this so for example I could use some arithmetic so I could say math dot random times 10 and now this will give me a whole number and I can also just round these numbers so I could say like math round and then inside of here I can pass this entire value so I'm saying math dot round and I'm rounding this entire number right so you can kind of like embed these functions inside of each other so now we're just gonna get a whole number so this would be equivalent to like rolling a 10 sided diary we're a random number between 1 and 10 zero and 10 so those are some basic math methods obviously when you're working with numbers like these can be really useful and it really just like takes a lot of the hassle out of doing some common mathematical operations 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you about getting input from a user now one of the great things about programs is that we can allow users to interact with them and in this tutorial I want to show you guys the basics of letting a user give your program some information now in JavaScript there's a lot of different ways that we can give our programs information we could use things like text boxes or buttons but in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys the most basic way that you can do it in JavaScript and that's by using something called a prompt so we're gonna prompt the user for input and then we'll use that input in order to do certain things in our program so down here I want to come and I want to create a variable and I'm gonna call this variable name and I'm actually gonna set this variable equal to a special value and we're gonna set it equal to window dot prompt and basically what this is doing is this is going to prompt the user to give us specific information and whatever information that the user gives us is going to get stored inside of this named variable and inside of these parentheses I can actually type a message for the user so in here I could say what is your name so we'll basically have a prompt box that prompts the user to give us their name and you'll see over here when i refresh the page this text box pops up right here and it says what is your name so over here I could type in my name Mike and I could click OK and eventually what we want to happen is we want to be able to access whatever the user types in and when I set up my program this way in other words when I create this variable called name and I set it equal to window dot prompt whatever the user types in when they click OK will get stored inside of this named variable so I can come down here and I can type document dot write and inside of these parentheses I just want to type out some information so I can say Hey and over here we're gonna add in that name variable and then I'm gonna type some more text something to say how are you today and what this is gonna do is it's basically gonna take the name that they enter in it's gonna say hey whatever the name is how are you today so I'll refresh the page and it says what is your name I'll say Mike and now on the screen it should print out hey Mike how are you today so I'm able to get information from the user using that JavaScript prompt I can store it inside of a variable and then I can access that variable in other places on my website for example here we're accessing this name variable and we're printing it out onto the screen so you can do this as many times as you want so I could actually have another prompt here and why don't we just copy this guy and we'll paste it down here and we'll make another prompt called age so we'll say how old are you and we're storing this age inside of this age variable so down here in this document right I can say hey name how are you today do you like being and then we'll add in that age variable and we can say years old so now when i refresh my page instead of just getting that one prompt for the name we're actually gonna get two separate prompts so I can refresh the page it says what is your name my name is Mike and I'll click enter and now it says how old are you and we could just say whatever Psalm 23 and now it'll print this whole thing out and says hey Mike how are you today do you like being 23 years old and if i refresh this program it'll give me another set of prompts so now I could make up some different information let's say my name is Steve and I'm like 80 years old now it'll modify this program so say hey Steve how are you today do you like being 80 years old so we're able to get information from the user and we're able to use that information inside of our program so this is just the basics and you this is the easiest way that you can get information from someone inside of JavaScript 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about creating a basic calculator in JavaScript so we're gonna make a little calculator where the user can enter in two numbers and then our program will take those two numbers add them together and then spit out the result onto the screen so it's gonna be a pretty basic calculator but I'm excited to show you guys how to do it the first thing we want to do when we're creating this calculator is get input from the user so we're gonna need to get two separate numbers from the user so I'm actually gonna create two variables so I'm gonna say they're numb one is equal to and we're gonna set num 1 equal to window dot prompt and basically what window dot prompt does is it'll prompt the user for input and then it'll return whatever they input so we'll be able to store whatever the user inputs into the prompt inside of this num1 variable and then inside of these parentheses here we just want to type out the message that we're gonna give to them so I can say enter a number and now we have this variable 1 set up so I'm also going to create another variable we'll just call it variable 2 or a variable num 2 and again just set it equal to window dot prompt and now I'll say enter another number so we're entering in two numbers here and they're getting stored in num1 and num2 so last thing we want to do is print out the result of adding those two numbers onto the screen so I can say document dot write and I'm just gonna put num1 plus num2 okay so everything's set up let's go over to our website and test this out I'm gonna refresh the page you'll see here we get this prompt enter a number so let's say I want to enter in five and second number let's say we want to enter in 2.3 so the program ran it added the two numbers together but you'll notice that we got this kind of a weird answer I mean we added 5 and 2.3 but instead of getting 7.3 which should be the answer we got 50 2.3 actually what's happening here is the program isn't actually adding 5 and 2.3 when you enter in text into those prompt text boxes no matter what you put in there javascript always just converts it into a string so I can put numbers in that text box all day long but no matter what javascript is just gonna take that out those numbers convert them down into a string and when you add two strings together the strings just get concatenated so like the first string just gets appended with the last string and you just get like one big string which is what happened here so in order to be able to add these two numbers together we have to use another special JavaScript function which will basically convert a string that has numbers in it into a number and what I can do is I can come down here and I can basically just convert these two num1 and num2 variables into actual numbers so I can take the strings I can grab the numbers that are inside of them and make them numbers so that we can add them together so I could say num 1 is equal to and now I want to use a special function it's called a parse int and inside of this parse int function we just want to pass in the number so I'm going to say number 1 or actually we're passing in a string so I can do that with num 1 I can also do that with num2 so Satan up to num2 so now when I come over to my website basically num1 and num2 should have the number values that were inside of those strings so we're refresh and i'm gonna enter in some new numbers so we'll enter in 5 and we'll enter in 3 and you'll see here we get what we expected which is 8 so it added the two numbers together instead of getting 5 concatenated with 3 inside of a string we just got the result 8 but there's another problem with this calculator so if I was to refresh the page again if I enter in a decimal number so if I entered in like five point five and we entered it in like ten instead of getting fifteen point five which we should get we're just getting fifteen and here's the problem we're using this method or this function down here called parse int and basically what that means is it'll take the string and it'll convert it into an integer number now generally when we're talking about integers and a programming language we're talking about whole numbers so these would be like counting numbers like one two three four five integers aren't decimal numbers so when we say parse in we're taking whatever number is inside of this variable and we're just converting it to a counting number converting it to an integer if I want to be able to use decimal numbers instead of saying parse in I can say parse float and what this will do is it'll basically like look at both of those numbers and it'll look for decimals as well as just looking for a whole number so now when we enter in the same numbers we can say 10 and 5.5 you'll notice that we get fifteen point five instead of just getting 15 so sometimes in certain circumstances you're gonna want to use parse int in other circumstances you're gonna want to use parsefloat for our calculator parsefloat ended up being the right function to use so that's how you can build a basic calculator obviously this is super basic all it can do is add two numbers but as we go through this course you'll figure out ways that you can make this calculator more powerful and more dynamic 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using arrays in JavaScript an array is basically a special type of JavaScript structure that allows you to store multiple values inside of it the most basic way to store a value in JavaScript is to use a variable but generally variables can only store one specific value right so a variable could store a string or a consorted number but usually it can only store one string or one number we can actually create something called an array which is a special container a lot like a variable but the array container can hold multiple values so I could hold like two or three strings or two or three numbers or I could hold a couple strings and a couple numbers and maybe a boolean arrays are a great way to store large amounts of information so I'm gonna show you guys how you can create an array and then we'll talk about like working with arrays and doing a bunch of stuff with them I'm actually gonna create a variable and I'm just gonna call it fruits and you'll notice that when you create an array you create it a lot like you would a variable so we can store an array inside of a variable like this but it's a special type of variable it's an array and I can say equals and I want to use this word new and then I can type array and now inside of here I can pass this array some information and basically we're just gonna specify like what information we want this array to have so what values do we want to store inside of it so I can just pass in some strings and so we have this fruits array so I'll pass in some fruits we can say like apples oranges and peaches and so we now have this array and we've passed into it a bunch of different values so what I can do now is I can go over here to this document dot write and I can actually just print out this array so I can say fruits and now out on the screen we'll print this array so it's printing out all of the values inside of that array and it's pretty awesome it works really well so this is one way that we can create an array but you'll notice that it's kind of like syntax heavy right we have to say new array and then we need these like parentheses and then we have to like you know passing all these values there's actually another way that we can create an array which is a lot easier in my opinion instead of saying new array we can just create these square brackets and then inside of these square brackets we can just put all of these values so then we don't have to say new array anymore we can just create an array like this and you'll see that it's the same thing so it's doing the same thing now arrays are great because we're storing multiple pieces of information so if I wanted I could store something other than a string I could store like a number 24 and I could also store like a boolean value so I could say false you can sort all different types of data inside an array in JavaScript and you see it all shows up just like that so imagine if I wanted to access a specific piece of information from inside of this array well I can do that by directly accessing it so what I can do is after I say fruits here I can make an open and closed square bracket and then I can type in the index of the element in the array that I want to access now arrays are indexed a lot like strings are indexed so if you know how strings are indexed you'll know that when we index a string we start with 0 so if I was counting off all of the letters inside of this string I would say 0 1 2 3 and it's the same with arrays so if I was to say what's the zeroth element in array in the array it's gonna be this so I would say this Apple is is element 0 24 is element 1 and false is element 2 so I start off with 0 1 and 2 so if I wanted to act that's a specific element inside of this array I can just access it by typing in the index so I could say 0 for example and now this will just give me apples I could say 2 and this should give me false right it's giving me that third value if I was to access try to access something that's not inside of this array and you'll see we get undefined because we haven't actually defined a fourth element or if an element at the third index position inside of this array so it's how you can access individual elements in the array you can also access specific properties about this array so if I wanted I could figure out like how many elements were inside of the array I could say dot length and what this will do is it'll print out how many items we have in this array so it's going to print out three because we have one two three items and when you're creating these are raised if you wanted to make it a little bit more organized you could also create them on multiple lines so I could say like apples and then 24 down here and then false down here and you can see this is like a little bit maybe better for us to create it so we can create it on multiple lines and JavaScript doesn't care it's just gonna do the same thing another thing we can do with these arrays is we can actually modify some of the values inside of them so if I wanted I could change one of these values so I can say over here we can say fruits and I can access an individual attribute so I could say fruits and we could say 0 and now what we can do is set it equal to something else so I can say fruits 0 is equal to and instead of apples why don't we make this oranges so now when I print out fruits 0 instead of getting apples like before we're gonna get oranges because I've modified the value of this particular element in the array so each element in the array can be thought of as like a variable in itself so right here I'm basically accessing a string variable if I was to say fruits 1 and I could change this to like a different number now I'm accessing a number so that's kind of how you can into modify values in an array another thing you can do is create an array from a comma separated list so instead of defining like apples 24 falls if I had a string so let's say I had a string and it was like comma separated so I had apples oranges peaches I can use a special string function so I could say fruits and then I could say dot split and inside of here I can pass in what I want to split this up with so I could say if I passed in a comma this would actually split this entire string up into an array and it would get its elements by figuring out where these commas are so it would grab this element and then they would see the comma so we know it has to grab another element see the comma has to grab another element so I can put in a comma in here and now when I print out fruits 0 it should just be apples and actually we need to set fruits equal to this so I would say fruits is equal to fruits don't split and now we'll get apples so if I said like - we should get peaches so that's kind of how you can split up an existing string into an array so I could use a different delineator I could use like if I wanted I could use an exclamation point and now it'll do the same thing as long as I put exclamation point down here so it'll split it up into an array based off of a particular delineator so arrays are just a great way to store multiple values inside of a single container and you know you can see over here this container is called fruits and then we're able to access that container and access the individual elements inside of that container using these square brackets 




in this tutorial I want to talk to you about using functions in JavaScript now a function is basically just a little block of code that's designed to perform a specific task so I can take a bunch of lines of code inside of JavaScript put them inside of a JavaScript function and then I can call that function and use whatever the code inside of that function is doing to perform a specific task so in this tutorial I want to show you guys how to create functions we're going to talk about giving functions different information and then we'll talk about how functions can give us information when they're done running so I'm gonna create a function down here and let's just say we want to create a very simple function which will say hi to the person writing the JavaScript so I can create a function by typing out the function keyword so I can tell you function and now I want to give this function a name so I want to name this function and I'm just going to call this say hi and once you've typed out the function name they need to type an open and close parenthesis and then an open and closed curly bracket and then inside of this open and close curly bracket what we can do is we can start writing code for our function and in our case why don't we have this function just print something out onto the screen so I can say document dot write and inside of here I can just put any HTML that I want to write out to the page so why don't we put an header one and I can say hello user and there you know let's say hello to me so say hello Mike so now whenever I execute this function what its gonna do is it's going to print out this header one that says hello Mike onto the screen and so I can actually access this function by calling it so I'm gonna go down below this function and when I want to access a function in other words when I want to call a function and use all the code inside of here I can just type out the name of the function so I just type say hi and then open and closed parenthesis so now what's gonna happen is this will get printed out onto the screen so you'll see that it prints out hello Mike as a header so that's like pretty cool it works really well and if I wanted I could change this so I could say like hello Tom and it will change that or if I wanted I can even add in more code to this function so obviously this is a really you know simple function but I could also put like an alert inside of here and I could alert out you know something I could say like hey and so now when I run this function it's gonna do this alert and it's also going to print out hello Tom so this is a very basic function and really you can put any code inside of here that you want any valid JavaScript code is gonna work so if I wanted I could even create something like a variable so I could say variable name is equal to and I could set this equal to like and show and now instead of printing out Tom what I can print out is the variable name so I can use this plus sign and I can actually put inside of here the name variable so see what I'm doing here is I'm actually writing out part of the string and then I'm concatenated onto that string the value inside of this name variable and then I'm concatenated onto that this other h1 tag and so what should happen now is it should use this variable name inside of this statement so it should say hello Joe which it does so if I was to change Joe to like Steve then it's gonna change as well so this is a basic function and again you can use variables you can use really whatever you want inside of these functions but you can also take these functions a step further so I can like supercharge these functions and I can actually give these functions specific information so imagine that instead of just defining this Steve variable right here this name variable imagine if I wanted to tell the function which name I wanted it to say hi to well to do that I can actually pass in something called a parameter and a parameter is basically a variable that you're giving to well it's a variable or a value that you're giving to the function so I can get rid of this their name and instead what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say up here I'm the same name so instead of creating a variable called name I'm just gonna specify a name up here and what this is gonna do is it's gonna tell JavaScript that this function is gonna take in a value so in other words when we call this function when I specify name here what this means is that I have to give this function a name so if I didn't give this a name so if I just said say hi right here it'll say hello but it'll say hello undefined because we haven't actually given this function a name if I come over here though and I pass in a name so if I pass in like Mike now instead of saying hello undefined it's gonna say hello Mike because I'm passing this function this say hi function a parameter I'm giving it a value right and I can specify which values I want to have passed into the function by just saying the name up here inside of this parentheses so I can say name here and that will automatically store the value that I pass in inside of this name so if I wanted then I could create another say hi so we could say say hi Mike and say hi Joe so now it'll say hello Mike and it'll also say hello Joe so you can see we're doing both of these so I can call this function as many times as I want with as many names as I want and because I'm passing in information each time we execute that function it's gonna use a different value to do what it's supposed to do so that's kind of how functions can be useful and you can use parameters to pass different information in I can also pass in multiple pieces of information so and it doesn't do a name I could also pass in something like an age so now below here we can make another document right and we can write out instead we can put like a paragraph and we could say you are this a so now what it'll do is it'll print out in addition to printing out hello and the name it'll also tell me what age they are so if I want to add in another parameter over here all I have to do is just type a comma and now I'll pass in a number so I can say like 23 or something and when i refresh the page you'll see that it says hello Joe you are 23 and I can modify both of these values so now I can make it say hello Mike you are 23 and I can control each of these parameters differently right so I could call this say hi function with any combination of name and age and it'll be able to display it on the screen just like that and that's really where functions can come in handy right I can write out a bunch of code inside of this function I can pass it some information and it can then use that information to perform its function differently so the function of this say hi function is to print out some messages onto the screen but depending on the name and the age that I give it its gonna do it slightly differently and that's why you know that's how it functions can be really powerful now there's one more thing that you can do with functions which you can have functions return specific values to you so right now when I call this function it's printing stuff out onto the screen but let's say that I wanted to make a different function so I'm gonna make a really simple function and it's just gonna be called addition and this is you know obviously gonna be a function which is gonna add two numbers so now instead of passing in a name and an age I'm gonna pass in num1 and num2 and i don't want to actually write anything out to the document all I'm gonna do in this addition function is I'm gonna have it accept two parameters so two numbers as input and I'm just gonna add those numbers together so I'm gonna pass in like four and five and inside this function what we want to do is we want to add num1 plus num2 right that's what this function would do it would add those two numbers together we will notice over here you know when we're using this at addition function we're not really gonna try to print anything out to the screen right the in other words like this addition function doesn't care about printing anything to the screen all it wants to do is add these two numbers the question becomes how can I get the result of these two numbers when I call this addition function right so for example if I was to print out the result of this addition function so I can call this addition function you'll see that we're not actually gonna get a value from this we're just going to get undefined but what I can do is I can have this addition function return the result of num1 plus num2 and then we'll be able to get a value from this so I can use a special word which is called return and when I type return what its gonna do is it's gonna return whatever is over here so in this case it's going to return the result of num1 plus num2 so now when I call this function this is gonna actually represent of value so this will represent the value of four plus five so we're gonna get nine and when I have this function return a value when I call the function down here this will now get a value back so I can say addition four plus four or five and it'll return to me the result of the addition between those two numbers so sometimes when you're writing functions you're not gonna want to have them return any information like that last function we did all it had to do is just print some stuff out onto the screen but in other cases you're gonna want to have a function return sum of different values and this is a great way to do that so another thing I could do just to sort of illustrate this point is create a variable so I could say variable added numbers and I can set this equal to the addition of let's say like four and a hundred right so now this added numbers variable is gonna have the value of four plus 100 in other words it's going to have the value that this addition function returns so if I was to print out this out in numbers variable you'll see that we get a hundred and four so that's how you can have functions give you back and a lot of times you're gonna want to have functions do specific things maybe do some like operations and then give you some information back but other times you're not going to so if you need information back you always want to use this return statement and then whatever you put after this return statement is gonna get returned back to the user 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about accessing at the HTML on your website using JavaScript so I'm gonna show you how you can access individual HTML elements on your website only using Java scripts this is really cool you can use JavaScript and you can grab different HTML elements you can modify them you can change their styling you can change different attributes about them all just from the JavaScript I'm gonna show you guys the basics of doing that today so over here on my little website I have two things the first thing is a header one it just says JavaScript and the second is a link and this is linking to the draft Academy website I wanna show you guys how I can access those elements from inside the JavaScript and modify certain things about them so if you look over here in this index.html file I just want to point out a couple things about this the first thing is down here this header one is just a basic header one but we've given it an ID of header so it has an ID set and that ID is called header and this link down here has an ID of link I've also given this link in each ref and it's just the draft Academy websites URL and then finally down here below both of these elements below the h1 and the anchor tag we have the script tag so this is where my JavaScript is getting imported into the file so these are all really important I just wanted to point these different things out before we get started so let's try to access this header on our website from inside the JavaScript if I want to access a specific element I can use a certain JavaScript function so we're gonna type document dot and now we want to type in the JavaScript function that will allow us to grab an element from the HTML we can say get element by ID and inside of these parentheses I want to type in the ID of the element that I want to grab so in my case I can just say header so that header one that I just showed you guys had an ID of header and so if I say document by ID header it's actually gonna get this document or it's actually gonna get the header so what I can actually do is store this inside of a variable so I'm gonna create a variable and I'm just gonna call it header and we'll set it equal to this entire thing and so now this header is actually gonna store inside of it the h1 element that's on our HTML page so over here this whole statement right here document dot get element by ID header is going out to the HTML and it's saying okay where is an element on the page that has an ID of header whichever element has that ID it's gonna grab that element and in our case we're gonna store it inside of this header variable so that's basically what's going on so I want to show you once we have this stored inside of a variable we can do certain things to it and the first thing we can do is we can actually modify what the header is saying so we can modify what's inside of the actual header tag and I can say header dot inner HTML and this is another sort of like attribute so this header is actually what's called a JavaScript object and basically what that means is it just has certain information that we can access about it and one of those pieces of information is inner HTML and that's basically what's inside of those header tags so I can set this equal to overridden and when i refresh the page you'll see that instead of saying JavaScript this is now gonna say overridden because I've actually overridden the text that was inside of that h1 and I've inserted my own text so I could say like Mike's new h1 here basically anything that I put inside of these quotation marks is gonna go inside of this h1 so basically I'm using this document I get element by ID function I'm grabbing the element that I want and then I'm storing it inside of a variable and I'm changing the inner HTML now I want to point something out before we go any further which is the location of this script tag so if you notice down here this script tag is stored below the h1 and this link and that's actually significant remember that this script tag is where this JavaScript is getting inserted into the page so if I was to take this JavaScript statement and put it up here above the h1 and the link you'll notice that this is actually gonna stop working and so all the changes that I made to this header 1 are actually gonna go away and the reason behind that is because I'm actually executing the JavaScript inside of this script before I create the h1 or the link so the browser basically goes and executes this javascript file and it does everything inside of it but when it does that this header one and this link haven't been created yet so since the header one hasn't been created there's no element on the page with an ID of header and therefore none of what I'm doing is gonna work right when I say get element by ID there's no element with header because it hasn't been created yet so I want to make sure that I put these script tags below the elements that I want to access and that's just like some basic housekeeping rules so let's go back to the script tag and see what else we can do inside of this script J's file I'm just changing the inner HTML but I can actually change other things as well so you'll see this will start working now because I move the script tags back one thing I could do is modify the style so I can say header dot style and I can actually access an individual attribute from inside the style so I can say dot color for example and color is a CSS attribute that we would put inside the style and I can modify the color so I could say red so basically what I'm saying is header style color so I'm accessing one of the CSS attributes for this HTML element and I'm setting it equal to red so what you'll see over here is that this header now gets turned red so I'm modifying the color I can also modify other things so I could in addition to modifying the color I could also modify like the background color so I could set this equal to the loo and you'll see now we have a background color of blue and the text is colored red so you can access individual CSS attributes from inside of this header variable by referring to the style and so that's one way that we can modify stuff about this header let's say that we wanted to modify something about this link so I'm gonna change this header over here to link and we'll get instead of getting the header we're just gonna get that link attribute so I'll say link and now this link variable should give me access to this link down here so you'll notice when I click this link it brings me to Jeff Academy comm brings you to the draft Academy website but I can actually modify that href attribute from inside my JavaScript so I could say link dot href and now whatever I put in here is gonna be the value of the href so I could say like amazon.com and now instead of linking me to draft academy.com like I specified over here inside of the HTML it's gonna link me to amazon.com so when i refresh the page I click this you'll see instead of going to draft Academy com I went to amazon.com so really once I have access to this link variable and otherwise once I've once I've gotten the element from the document I can access any of the attributes that would normally be inside of that element so href is an attribute that is inside of this link tag right I have href right here so I could modify that just by referring to it by name style is another attribute that we could put in here right so for the header we were able to modify the style normally you would say style is equal to whatever and then you put your style text in there but from my JavaScript file I was able to modify the style and if you wanted instead of referring to each one of those individual style attributes like we did with the I could just say link dot style and basically just give this whatever style I want it so I could say you know color blue or let's do red and now this link is gonna have red text so you could put an entire CSS string inside of here and it'll modify the style so the point is that we can grab elements off of the screen off of the HTML and then we can modify them we can do whatever we want to them I can change what's inside of them I can change the style I could change the href I could change any attribute inside of that HTML element and it'll update on the page just like it does here 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you about event listeners in JavaScript an event listener is basically something in JavaScript where you can run a specific function or a specific block of code when a user does something so for example if a user clicked on a button I could then call a function and do something or if a user like hovered over an image or something we could perform a specific function or if the user scroll down or pressed a specific key on the keyboard we could do something basically event listeners allow you to monitor certain HTML elements or certain elements of the HTML page and then when the user interacts with them you can perform certain functions so I'm gonna show you guys how to do that the first thing we're gonna do is have something happen when I click this button so I'm this big button over here and when I click it nothing happens not really a good button right over here in my HTML file you can see down here we have just this button it has like an ID it says click mean I'm gonna show you guys how you can execute a JavaScript function when this button gets clicked so there's actually a certain HTML attribute that we can give to this and I can say on click and I can say equals and then quotation marks and this is what's called a JavaScript event so on click is a JavaScript event and when the user clicks on this button the JavaScript code that's inside of these quotation marks is gonna get executed so if I wanted I could put some JavaScript code in here and I'll just say alert you whoops these need to be single you click to mean right so I'm saying on click I want to execute the following JavaScript code alert you clicked me out onto the screen so now when i refresh the page and I click the button you'll see that we get this alert it says you clicked me right and that's kind of cool and so whatever code I put inside of these quotation marks is gonna get executed when I click that button although here's the problem it's like putting you know a bunch of JavaScript code inside these quotation marks it's kind of a drag and if you're writing a lot of JavaScript you're not gonna want to put it inside of there so what we can actually do is call a function from inside of this on click and then we can execute that function in like an external javascript file so I could write a function here I could say handle click and now whenever this button gets clicked it's going to execute a JavaScript function called handle click so I'm gonna go over to my script J s file and this is my external javascript file that's linked up with that HTML file and I'm going to create a function called handle click and inside of this function now any code that I put in here is gonna get executed when I click the button so I can write out an alert that says clicked and now when i refresh the page I click the button this function gets run so that's the basics of handling like a click event for example when that button gets clicked now this function is gonna get run and I can also put this same thing on the image so if I wanted I could copy this on click line right here and I'm just gonna paste it over here on this image so now when we click the image that handle click function is also going to get called so I click the button we get the alert if I click the image we also get the alert so these events can be used on any HTML it doesn't really matter what it is but here's another question is let's say I wanted to when I click this button I wanted to change the text on the actual button well I'm gonna have to be able to access that button and what you can do is you can pass a parameter inside of this handle click function and you can actually pass the current element that's calling it so in here I can just say this and when I use this keyword what this is gonna represent is the current element that's calling this or the current element that's getting clicked so this is actually going to represent this button so when I go over here into my JavaScript file now I can just add in a parameter up here we'll just say element and now I'll be able to access the element that got clicked so we can get rid of this alert and I'm gonna say element inner HTML so I'm gonna modify the inner HTML in this button and I'll just set it equal to clicked so now when I come over here and I click this button you'll see that the text changes from click me to click so every time I click this the text is gonna change so really I could do anything I want if I clicked this I could instead of setting the inner HTML I could set the style and we could like change the background color to blue so now when I click the button the background color is gonna get changed to blue so that's kind of the basics of using an on click with an HTML element and then you can see how we can pass in the current element that's doing the clicking into this function and then we can access it and modify it so that's one way that we can use these event listeners there's another way that we can do it though and we can do it entirely from the JavaScript so when we did this we had to put this on click attribute on this actual HTML element but there's a way to for example monitor for a click or monitor for a different event without having to use the attribute inside the HTML and I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that with this image so what I want to do is whenever I hover over the image I want to make the image a little bit bigger and I want to give it like a background shadow so it looks like we're hovering over it so I'm gonna come over here into my JavaScript file and I'm actually gonna create a variable and I'm gonna make a variable for that image element so I'm basically gonna grab that image element off the page so I'll say there and we'll just call this image is equal to document dot get element by ID and the ID of that image I believe is just image so actually let's double check that so yeah the idea is just image right there so this image variable is actually storing that image over here this picture of the draft Academy logo so I can say image dot AB event listener and what this is gonna do is it's basically gonna add an event listener onto this HTML element so remember we had to physically add that on-click event listener on to that button element but this is gonna do it for us using JavaScript so I want to pass this to parameters and the first is going to be the event that we want to watch out for so in our case we want to call this event listener when the mouse hovers over the image so there's an event called mouse over and basically what this will do is it will execute some code when the mouse goes over the HTML element and the second parameter we can pass is the actual code that we want to execute so what we can do is we can put a function inside of here and you want to pass this a function and you'll notice here I'm creating a function I'm just saying function open and closed parentheses open and close curly brackets and I'm just gonna click enter and now any of the code that we want to execute when the mouse goes over this image we're just gonna put in here inside of this function that we passed in as a parameter so any code that I put in here is gonna get executed when my mouse goes over that image in our case we're gonna want to like I said modify some of the styling about that image now if I want to access that image HTML element all I have to do is save this and this is automatically gonna represent the element that just got moused over so I can say this dot style and I want to set the style equal to we'll give it a box shadow and it's just gonna be like two pixels two pixels two pixels and we'll make it gray so I'm gonna give this some styling and then I also want to modify the size of the image so I'm gonna say this dot width and we'll set this equal to 150 pixels or just 150 so now when I mouse over this image you'll notice that this event handler is going to get called and so the image is going to get a little bit bigger and you'll see that there's this shadow under here so actually this is a little too big let's just set it equal to 110 so now when I mouse over the image you see it gets a little bigger we get that box shadow but here's the problem is when I mouse over the image it gets big but then when I Mouse out of the image nothing happens right it just stays the same so what I want to happen is when my mouse enters this image I want it to get bigger and where my mouse exits the image I wanted to get smaller so we can actually just create another event listener so I'm gonna copy this guy right here I'm gonna paste it but now instead of waiting for the mouse over event I'm gonna wait for the mouse out event and this will be called when the mouse leaves the HTML element so in that case we can just set the style back to nothing we'll get rid of that box shadow and we'll set the width back to a hundred which is what it was initially so now this should actually work so when I hover over the image it gets bigger and when I hover out of it it gets smaller so you can see how this basically makes the image like responsive to my mouse and that's kind of a common thing that you'll see in a lot of like websites is when you mouse over an image it gets a little bit bigger so that's the basics of using javascript event listeners again one method to do this is to put the event listener directly on the element like we did with this on click so you can literally just add the attribute onto the element the other method would be to do it through JavaScript so we can access the element we want and we can add an event listener and then we need to put the name of the event listener and we also need to include a function that's gonna get executed when that event is called in other words when the user Mouse's over or Mouse's out I want to point out one more thing which is the name of these events now there are you know dozens and dozens of these different events in JavaScript so I'm over here on this website it's called eight Gmail Dom events and it's a w3schools site and it's just w3schools calm for Tosh jsrf for slash Dom underscore obj underscore event so this is a great page because it lists out all of the events that you can watch for so you can see here's like on click and we have on mouse over down here on ma hsiao those are the ones that we use but there's so many more of these events like here's some keyboard events here's some frame object events clip board events so if somebody copies or cuts or pastes media events if somebody like plays a video or does something with media I mean there's all sorts of events that you can see there's just like this huge list so what you want to do is head over to this page or a similar page and check out all these different events that you can use I mean there's so many and you can play around with like changing different things on your website when certain things happen I mean this is like kind of like the core of JavaScript which is like you're able to monitor what's happening on the page and what the user is doing and based off of what the user does you're able to do other things in other words you're able to respond to the user and that's what's really cool about javascript and that's why these events are so awesome and I want to point one more thing out and this is just kind of a small thing but it's gonna come in handy so you'll notice over here on this mouse over in this Mouse out event it says onmouseover and onmouseout but when I use this event inside of my JavaScript over here you'll see that I instead of putting on a mouse out like this I just put mouse out and when you're using these events and you're using this add event listener you don't need to put the on with the event so in fact you don't want to put it at all so if I put on Mouse out this wouldn't work you just want to put mouse out you want to drop the on and that's for all of them but when you're over here in your HTML file and you're adding this as an attribute you always want to include the on so if I was to do like a mouse event I could say on Mouse out and so I'm gonna need beyond when I'm doing this on actual HTML file but if I'm using the add event listener function you don't need that on so that's just like a little tip and really like I would really encourage you guys to head over to this page or a page like this and play around with these different events because like I said this is really where JavaScript becomes responsive when you can respond to the user 




in this tutorial I want to show you guys how to build like a little basic messaging app in JavaScript now this isn't gonna be like a full-fledged messaging app but basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna be able to type some text inside of this text box over here we'll be able to click the send button and then that text will show up on the screen and so I can keep posting texts like little text messages and then that will just keep appearing on the screen it's gonna be kind of cool and it'll kind of give you an idea of how you can do something like this in JavaScript so I want to point out to you guys just my HTML really quick I have an unordered list and it has an ID of messages and inside of this unordered list we're actually going to put all of our messages so each message is gonna be like a list item and we'll end up putting all of them inside of this unordered list I also have this input text box right here and that's just that text box that you guys saw it has an ID of text box and then I have this button this send button and it just has an ID of button so like I said when we click this send button generally what's gonna happen is a new message will show up inside of this unordered list so let's head over to our JavaScript and we can start programming this the first thing I want to do is create variables for each one of these items I want to create a variable for this text box one for this button and then one for that unordered list so I'm just gonna create three variables and we'll just say their messages is equal to document dot get element by ID and inside of here we'll just pass in messages and then I'm just gonna copy this and do the same for the text box and we'll do the same for the button so I now have three variables each of which is grabbing the element on the screen so we're grabbing via messages list the textbox and the button so the first thing I want to do is create an event listener for this button in other words I want to be able to execute some JavaScript code when this button gets clicked so we can come down here we can say button dot add event listener and we'll be able to pass into this event add event listener function two parameters the first is the actual event that we want to watch for so I can say click and the next thing I want to pass in is a function that's gonna get executed when the button gets clicked and so the easiest thing for us to do would be just to define the function right here so I can do something like this so I'm creating this function and now I'll just make a new line and in here we can just write out all the code that we want to get executed when we press the button so let's think this through how can we make it so when the button gets clicked the message shows up in that unordered list well the first thing we can actually do is create a new element and so one of the things we'll need to do is create a list item that we can put inside of that unordered list and creating an element is actually not that difficult there's a JavaScript command that we can use in order to do that so I'm actually going to create a new variable and we'll store that element inside of the variable so I'll say their new message is equal to and now all I have to say to create a new element is say document dot create element and inside of here we just want to pass the name of the element that we want to create so in our case we're creating a list item so the name is just L I and that's how we can create a basic element but now what we need to do is we need to add in to this element the text that was inside of that text box right in other words I want the text inside of this list item to be the text was in the textbox so I can say new message dot inner HTML is equal to and now what I want to do is grab the text that's inside of that text box so what we can say is text box and this is referring to that text box variable that we created up here remember text box is just that text box that's on the screen and in order to get the text inside of it we can access the value attribute so text box type value is all the text that's inside of that text box so basically what I'm doing here is I'm just setting the inner HTML of the list item equal to the value that was inside of that text box right makes sense so now what I want to do is I want to add this list item inside of that unordered list in other words I want to put the list item in that list so it has a new item so I can use a JavaScript function called append child and what we want to do is access that message is unordered list so I can say messages dot append child and we just put in the new element that we want to append into this unordered list in our case it's just new message so assuming all of this works I can come over here refresh my page and if I type something in here and I click the send button it'll show up up here in that unordered list so I can you know type whatever I want into here and basically everything is gonna be fine here's the one thing though that we could improve right when I click send the text inside of this text box stays the same generally in a texting app when you click send the text inside of here will disappear so if we want to do that all we have to do is come down here add a new line and we can just say text box value is equal to the empty string so now the text box value will be empty whenever we enter in text so under in text click send and then you can see that the text disappears inside of the textbox so this is a really basic example and you know obviously like it's functional I can keep typing in whatever I want and it's gonna show up on the page so for our purposes we built like a mini texting app obviously you can't really text with other people but you know this kind of shows you like functionally how you can type something into a text box click a button and get it to show up on the page so I just want to recap real quick for you guys what I actually did here so over here in my index.html file have these three elements this Unruh list with the idea of messages the input with textbox and the button with the idea of button over here my JavaScript I created three variables so I created a messages variable and this was basically just storing the HTML element that unordered list I created the textbox variable which was storing the text box and I created the button which was storing the button and then I took that button and I added an event listener onto it and I was basically waiting for someone to click the button right and when they click the button I executed this function over here so this function is all of this code down here and inside of this function we created a new variable called new message and basically what I did was I set that equal to a new element on the page so I created a new HTML element on our page and it was just a list item and then I added text into that element so inside of the list item I put the value that was inside the textbox and then I appended that list item on to the messages unordered list right and then I set the text value equal to blank so all of that code and it really wasn't too much code when you think about it allowed us to have this functional little chatting app but you'll notice when i refresh the page everything disappears and the more we learn about javascript the more we'll learn about how to store those values so when we refresh the page they don't disappear and the more you learn about web development you'll learn you can actually like store all those little messages inside of something like a database and you know really make a fully functional app but for now that kind of shows you how you can do everything on the front end and create something functional like that 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using if statements in JavaScript now what's cool about if statements is we can use them to help our programs to make decisions so I can write a series of if statements and they'll basically say like when certain conditions are met I'll do certain things and when other conditions are met I'll do other things so with if statements our programs can actually respond to things that are happening so when one thing happens we can do something and when another thing happens we can do another thing so what I want to do first is just show you guys some examples of if statements that you encounter in the real world so actually as human beings we use if statements in our lives all the time and I want to show you guys some examples of that so you can wrap your head around what they're doing and then we'll move into the code and we'll start writing some if statements in JavaScript so I'm just over here on this text file and I've written out some if statements so here's one up here it says I wake up if I'm hungry I eat breakfast so this is actually an if statement you'll notice right here we have this condition so I'm saying if I'm hungry and this is a condition right this is either true or its false if this is true if I am hungry then I'm gonna go ahead and eat breakfast but if I'm not hungry in other words if this is false then I'm just gonna move on so I'm not gonna do anything here's another one it says I look at my phone if it's about to die I charge it so again this is another if statement we have this condition up here it says if it's about to die and that's either true or its false if it's true then we charge it if it's false then we don't do anything and we just move on right here's another if statement down here it says I leave my house if it's cloudy I bring an umbrella otherwise I bring sunglasses so this is a little bit different from the ones up here because we have this otherwise a word right so if this condition is true in other words if it is indeed cloudy then I'm gonna bring my umbrella but otherwise I'm gonna do something else so here we're basically saying like if the first condition is false and then we want to also try to do something else and in this case we're just going to bring sunglasses so this is a little bit more of a complex if statement but nonetheless it's a valid if statement and finally down here at the bottom we have this last one and this is even more complicated so it says I'm at a restaurant if I want meat I order a steak otherwise if I want pasta I order spaghetti and meatballs otherwise I order a salad and so this is an even more complex if statement because we're actually checking two separate conditions so I'm saying if I want meat and if that's true I get the steak but if that's false then I go down here and I actually check another condition so if we want meat then right away we order the steak and then we're done right we're good to go but if we don't want meat if this is false then we're gonna check to see if we want pasta so then if I want pasta I'll order spaghetti and meatballs but if this is also false then I'll just order the salad right so if I don't want meat or spaghetti then I'll just get a salad and everything will be good so this is a little bit more complex of an if statement because not only do we have one condition up here but if that's false we're also checking another condition so let's head over to our javascript file and we're actually gonna start writing some if statements in JavaScript so the first thing I want to do is create a variable and I'm just gonna create a variable and I'm just gonna call it is male and this variable is basically just gonna represent if somebody is a male so it's gonna be a true or a false value right there either male or they're not so I'm gonna say is male is equal to true let's say this person is a male I can actually use an if statement and depending on if this person is a male I can do something so I can say if and I can use these open and close parenthesis and then open and close curly bracket and inside of these parentheses I can check a condition so remember in that text file we had like if it's cloudy outside or if I'm hungry right we were checking different conditions the conditions are going to go inside of these parentheses in our case our condition we're checking to see if they're a male so I can say if is male and basically I'm just checking to see if this boolean variable has a value of true and if this variable has a value of true then I'm going to be able to execute whatever code is inside of these curly brackets so I'm just gonna say document dot write and we'll just write out like you are male and over here I can just refresh the page and you'll see it says you are male if I was to come over here to this is mayor a male variable and set it equal to false however so now is male is equal to false nothing's gonna show up because we're not actually going to execute any of the code that's inside of here because this was false and when this is false we just move on so we just move on to the next line that's outside of this if statement let's say that I wanted to do something else when is male was equal to false so when it's sure we write out you are male but when it's false let's say we wanted to write out you are not male I can use another keyword in JavaScript called else and this else any of the code inside of here is going to get executed whenever is male is equal to false so here we just type document right and we'll say you are not male and when i refresh the page since is male is equal to false it's gonna say you are not male so that's kind of cool and if I was just to set this equal to true now it'll say you are male so depending on the value of this is male variable my program is actually able to tell you different things so if it's male it can tell you it's male if it's not male it'll tell you that it's not male and that's basically how our programming can respond to different things using if statements we can also take these if statements to the next level however so if I wanted I could actually create another variable over here so let's do that I'll create a variable called is tall and is tall will basically represent whether someone is tall and we can actually set this equal to true and let's say inside of this if statement in addition to checking to see if the person was male I also wanted to check to see if they were tall I can use a special operator in java script called the and operator and I can say is male and and it's just these two ampersands and then I can say is tall so this entire condition is saying if they're male and they're tall then execute the code that's inside of here otherwise say that you are not male so we can actually change these strings so now I can say document up right and instead of just saying you are male I can say you are a tall male so I know for a fact that if is male is true and is tall is true then there a tall male otherwise we can say you are either not male or not tall right so the way this n works is that both of these conditions have to be true so is male has to be true and is tall has to be true if one of those guys isn't true then we'll execute this else code down here and actually we could say you are either not male or not tall or both it's possible that they will be both and so since both of these guys are true when i refresh the page it's gonna say you are it's all male which is correct at least for these variables if I was to change this is tall variable to false now instead of saying you're a tall male that's no longer true so we'll refresh the page and it'll say you are either not male or not tall or both so just by changing one of these variables our program was able to respond to it and if I was to change is male to false as well then it'll stick with this message because none of this is going to be true in addition to checking to see if is male and is tall I can check to see is male or is tall so instead of using this and operator I could use another operator called or and basically this or operator is going to check to see if they are male or if they are tall so unlike with the and operator both of these guys don't have to be true only one of them has to be true in order for the whole thing to be true so they can be a male and tall but they can also be male and short or they could be not male and tall it doesn't really matter and so we can actually change the text inside of here now instead of saying you are a tall male we would have to say you are either male or tall or both and so down here in this else we could actually change the text to say you are not tall and not male because the only situation where we're going to be executing this code is when they're not tall and not male so I'm gonna refresh the page and you'll see because both of these guys are false it says you are not tall and not male but if I was just to set one of these equal to true so let's set is male equal to true now it's gonna say you are either male or tall or both so it's able to recognize the condition so I want to show you guys how we can make more of these conditions so here we're checking to see is male or is tall and actually I want to change this to is male and is tall but let's say that we wanted to do something when they were male but when they were not tall so if they were like a short male we wanted to do something well I can use another keyword and JavaScript called else/if and I can just say else if and I need open and close parentheses and an open and close curly bracket so I'm gonna click enter and you can see now I have elsif with open and close parentheses and an open and close curly bracket inside of this parentheses we can check another condition so in the case that this condition up here is false and then we'll come down here and we'll check to see if Miss conditions true so we can add it in another condition we could say is male and let's check to see if they are not tall so here's a good question how can we check to see if they're not something in other words how can we check to see if something is not true well I can use what's called the not operator and it's basically just this exclamation point and I can put this exclamation point between my before my condition and it'll negate that condition so I can say not is tall and whenever you see this exclamation point you just want to say not so this is basically saying else if is male and not is tall so in other words if they're male and they're not tall then we want to do something so down here we could just write something else we could say like document right and in this case it'll be you are a short male and I want to change this one up here so this is gonna be you are a tall nail and then in addition to checking to see if they're male and they're not tall we also want to check one more condition which is going to be if they're not male but they are tall so if they're tall but they're not male so I'm going to create another else--if and inside of here we're gonna check to see if they're not male so not is male and is tall so over here we could write document right you are not male but you are taller so here we have a complete if/else block is what we would call this and it's checking all of the possible conditions for these two variables so we're checking to see if they're male and tall we're checking to see if they're male and not tall we're checking to see if they're tall and not male and otherwise we're just getting for both of them so actually down here in this else block we could say you are not tall and not male because we know for a fact that neither of those conditions is true so let's see if this is gonna work so right now we'll just set both of these guys equal to true so when i refresh the page it says you are a tall male perfect if I set is false equal to or is tall equal to false now it's gonna say you are a short male cool if I set is equally true or is tall equal to true and is male equal to false now it's gonna say that you are not male but you are tall and if I set both of them equals a false it's gonna say you are not tall and not male so hopefully that illustrates how you can use these if-else statements in order to check different conditions and these can be really powerful because like I showed you you know our program is able to respond to these variables so depending on the value of those variables were able to do certain things so that's the basics of if statements I hope you guys learn something there's also other ways that we can use these if statements so in addition to using boolean variables like this we can also use numbers we can check to see if different numbers match up or we can check to see if different strings match up I'm gonna talk about that in the next video but for now this has just been a basic introduction into if statements 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about some more ways that we can use if statements in JavaScript so in the last tutorial I showed you guys how you can use boolean variables in order to check for a condition so we check to see if someone was male or if they were tall and read out this entire if statement block in order to check that in this tutorial I want to show you guys how we can use something else to use if statement so we can actually compare different values inside of our if statements and depending on how those values relate to each other we'll do different things and one of the best ways for me to demonstrate this is to actually create something called a max function so I want to write a function inside of our JavaScript program where you can pass the function three different numbers and then it'll spit out whichever number is the highest so let's go and do that we're gonna create a function so I'm just gonna say function and we'll set it equal to Max and inside of this function I want to pass three parameters so up here in these parentheses I'm going to pass three values in here I'm going to say num1 num2 and num three so this max function is going to take three parameters and basically what we want to do in here is we want to figure out which number is the biggest right and we can actually use if statements to check to see which one is the biggest so I'm gonna say if and I'm gonna make an open or close parenthesis and an open a close curly bracket and now inside of this if statement inside of these parentheses we can write a condition so the first thing that I want to do is check to see if this first number right here is bigger than the other two right in other words if num1 actually if num1 is greater than or equal to both num2 and num three then we know num1 is the biggest so i can say if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and num1 is greater than or equal to num three then I can just return num1 because we know now for a fact that num1 is the biggest right in other words if number one is greater than or equal to number two and it's greater than or equal to number three then we know that's the highest value that we have so we can just return it and over here we're using these what are called comparison operators so in our case we're using a greater than or equal to comparison operator to compare both of these values now in the last tutorial if you watch the last tutorial we used boolean values in order to represent these conditions so a boolean value is either true or false and so when you put it into an if statement it just makes sense in our case though this comparison is actually gonna represent a true or a false value right this comparison is either true or its false num1 is either greater than or equal to num2 or it's not right so the computer will be able to look at this condition and evaluate it into a true or a false value and same goes for over here so if this condition ends up being true and this condition ends up being true then we'll return num1 otherwise if that's not true we can say else if and we want to check something else so here we'll check to see if number two is greater than all the other one so I can say else if num2 is greater than or equal to num one and num2 is greater than equal to num three so again we're comparing num2 and num1 and we're comparing num2 and num three and if num2 is the biggest then we'll just return it so we can say in them two now otherwise we're gonna use this else keyword otherwise if num1 isn't the biggest and num2 isn't the biggest then we can pretty much assume that gnome 3 is the greatest so we can say return num 3 so effectively what this will do is it'll take three numbers as input and it'll spit out the biggest one right easy enough so let's go ahead and call this function so I'm gonna come here and we'll just say max and I'm gonna pass this some values so we can say like three four five and this should go ahead and spit out a five or actually I need to write this to the screen so you'll see that it's spitting out of five so I can make you know whichever one of these the biggest we can put a ten in there or we could put a thirty in here and no matter what it's always gonna spit out whichever the biggest number is so I want to point out the way that we did this was using these comparison operators and this one is greater than or equal to but there's also a bunch of other comparison operators that we can use so we could use double equal sign and the double equal sign is basically checking to see if these have the same value so this is saying if num1 has the same value as num2 in other words if they're equal and in addition to equals equals we can use greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to and we can also use not equal to so this exclamation point is a special character called the not operator and basically what it does is it'll negate anything so we can say num 1 is not equal to num 2 and that's what that'll check so those are all the different operators that you can use and obviously over here we're comparing different numbers right so I'm comparing you know one number with another number but you could also compare different string values as well so if I wanted I could put strings inside of there so let me demonstrate that really quick I'm just gonna get rid of this and why don't we create an if statement down here and I'm just gonna make a basic if statement just so you guys can see how this works I'll say if phrase so that's just the string is equal to phrase then we can print out true and you'll see over here that we get true so you can check to see if different our equal to each other basically if they have the same characters stuff the basics of building a max function and using comparisons in order to get boolean values inside of our if statement conditions and a lot of times you're gonna want to use these different comparisons inside of your if statements so you can you know basically check different values and depending on whether or not those values are the same or ones bigger or smaller than the other one you can do different things 



in this tutorial I want to show you guys how you can use switch statements in JavaScript a switch statement is basically just a special type of if statement that we can use to compare one value to a bunch of different values so in a lot of circumstances when you're trying to help your program make decisions you're gonna want to use an if statement but in some special circumstances you're gonna want to use a switch statement and it will seriously make your life way easier so I'm gonna show you guys how you can use switch statements and we'll talk about in what situations switch statements are appropriate so for the purposes of this tutorial let's say that I want to make a function which takes as an input a number and it'll spit out the corresponding day of the week so it'll take in a number between 0 and 6 and depending on what the number is it'll spit out a different day of the week so here's I just kind of drew this little like map so I'm mapping numbers to days so we could say 0 is equal to sunday 1 is equal to Monday and etc 5 is gonna be equal to Friday 6 Saturday so if I pass this function as 0 it would return Sunday and my passed it a 5 it will return Friday etc so that's the kind of function that we want to write in this tutorial I'm gonna show you guys how we can do that how we can use switch statements to make that really easy so we'll create a function and I'm just gonna call this get day name right that's basically what it's doing and inside of this function we are going to accept one piece of information which is going to be the day right so this would be the number of the day so 0 through 6 and over here I can just create a variable call it day and as we go through this function will set day equal to either Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday etc and then down here at the bottom we can just return day so this method or this function will actually return the string day so one way that I could actually go about writing this function is using something like an if statement so I could just say if day num is equal to zero and if this is the case then we can just say day is equal to Sunday and then I can come down here we can make another one else if and we'll check to see if day num is equal to one and if this is the case actually we need curly brackets then we'll set day equal to Monday etc so I could do this for every single day of the week right and I can make else ifs for each one and then we have a functioning program right this would work we could do this with an if statement but this is like really sort of context heavy you can see there's a lot of code here and you know using analysis and then writing this whole condition out each time is a little bit tedious now this is a situation where we would actually want to use a switch statement and what I want you guys to notice about this is that for each one of the conditions inside of this itself if else block so for this condition up here and for this condition down here and then for the next you know five conditions that we would have to write we're basically checking to see if de num is equal to a different values so in every single one of those conditions we're checking if this same variable de num is equal to a different value and if you have a situation like that where you're checking to see if the same variable is equal to a value and each one of your is if else conditions then you have a perfect candidate for a switch statement so in our case this is a perfect candidate and I can actually use a switch statement and it'll make writing this entire thing a lot easier so I'm going to show you guys how we can do that to create a switch statement we just say switch and we're gonna make an open and close parenthesis and open and closed curly brackets so this is the basic outline for a switch statement actually looks kind of like an if statement inside of this parenthesis I want to put the value that I'm gonna be comparing in each one of my conditions so in our case it's daenam right we are comparing daenam to zero one two three four five six we're comparing it seven different times and so whatever value you're comparing you want to put it inside of these parentheses now down here we can specify what happens during each case so in other words if daenam is equal to zero we can do something if Daniel is equal to one we can do something that's how we can use switch David so I can say case and this is a JavaScript keyword and then we can type out the value that we want to compare daenam - so I'm gonna say zero and then I just want to type out a colon so basically what this is saying is in the case that de num is equal to zero we want to do something and then down here on the new line I'm just gonna write out a code block basically specifying what I want to do so in our case we want to set day equal to Sunday right and then once I write out my little code block I can just make a new line and I'm just gonna tie it break and this break keyword will basically break us out of this switch statement so since we figured out what daenam was and we set day equal to sunday we're done with this switch statement so we can just sort of break out of it and there's no need to do anything else so I can actually make one of these for each number so I could say case 1 and now in the case of 1 we want to say day is equal to Monday and we can again just say break so you can see that this is a lot cleaner than using those if-else blocks and it's also just a lot easier to visualize right so it's way easier for me to see like okay in the case that it's zero we're doing this and the cases 1 we're doing that so it's a lot cleaner and honestly a lot easier to write and manage so I'm actually gonna create one of these for each day of the week and then we'll come back and we can talk about how this is gonna work alright so I've gone ahead and made a case for every single day of the week so you can see we have case 0 1 2 3 4 etc we have one for every single day of the week and you know even though we're checking seven different conditions you can see this is actually pretty clean right so it's really easy for me to see you know what each one of these things is doing and it's really easy for me to visualize and that's why switch statements can come in handy all right so let's test this function out we'll see how it does so I'm just gonna say get de name and we're gonna pass this a value so I'll just pass it at zero and actually why don't we print the answer out onto the screen so I'll say document right and we'll just print out the result that we get back so this one should print out a day of the week so in our case it should print out Sunday which it does I could pass in any number now for example 4 and it'll give me Thursday so it's gonna give me like whatever day of the week for the number I pass it so mission accomplished right we created the function we wanted to create here's a problem what happens if I pass in a 90 for example right so I pass in the value of 90 and I'm gonna refresh the page you'll see that we get undefined right that's because I don't actually give this day variable of value until one of these cases is true and so if none of these cases is true then this day is never gonna get a value it's always going to be undefined and this is where the default case statement can come in so inside of a switch statement you can actually create another little case here and we just call it default so I can just type default colon and now down here this code will execute when none of these cases are true so if none of these things are the case then this is gonna get executed so I could just say des is equal to and now we could just pass like a error message so we could say like des doesn't exist and actually we can make this more detailed so we could say Dana isn't a valid number and over here instead of getting undefined now we'll get this error message so des doesn't exist 90 isn't a valid number so if I passed in I mean really I could pass in any number will pass in like a 60 same thing right and it's giving us a detailed error message but if I pass in a correct date so if I passed in like two now it's gonna give me the correct day so that's how you can use switch statements to build this function and also how we can this default statement in order to send like an error message 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using objects in JavaScript an object is basically a collection in JavaScript where we can store a bunch of named values now if you're familiar with arrays in JavaScript an object is actually pretty similar to an array although there are some key differences so if I wanted to create an array inside of JavaScript I could like make a variable and we'll call it my array and I could just give this a bunch of different values right so maybe this is like actually let's call this fruits and we'll store a bunch of fruits inside of here so I could say like apples oranges etc right I'm storing you know different values inside of this one array structure and an object is has a similar goal but with an object we're not just storing values we're storing name value pairs so we're storing like key value pairs and so let me show you the difference let's create an object and you'll kind of be able to wrap your head around what it's doing I'm gonna create an object called person and this object will basically define some information about myself so we'll make an object that will define information about me and when we make an object instead of using these square brackets we're actually gonna use curly brackets so I'm gonna make two curly brackets just like that and open and closed and a lot of times when you make an object people will make a new line and inside of this object I can define key value pairs so I can basically define different values and give names to those different values so for example if we're finding information about me I could say like name and I'll say name and I'm gonna use this : and now after this : I can give this a value so I can say like Mike and then we can define another attribute about me we could say age a colon and I'm gonna put a number in here 23 we could say is male and for me that's gonna be true and we could also say like occupation and I could say programmer so what you'll notice here is I'm creating an object that has a bunch of different named values inside of it so unlike an array where we created a container that just had a bunch of values when we're creating an object we're creating a container that has a bunch of names and values so these would be like key value pairs and you'll hear people refer to that they'll call these things key value pairs and basically all that means is that we're defining a key so like a unique key and then we're giving that a value now one of the things with objects is you can't have two of these attributes so this would be referred to as I can attribute you can't have two of these attributes with the same key so I couldn't make another one down here with name like you can only have one in other words these can't be repeated and you'll notice that I'm separating these using these commas and then on the last one I don't actually need a comma so this is a good example of defining an object and down here I'm just gonna put a semicolon to end this off so I could make an object to store all types of information I mean obviously here I'm storing information about a person but I can store you know any type of information that you can think of now the question becomes how can we access the information inside of this object well the easiest thing to do would just be to print it out to the screen so I can say document right and we'll just print this out to the screen so I'm just going to print out the this person object just like that so over here when i refresh the page you'll see that all that gets printed out is just this like little object thing inside of these square brackets and basically what this means is that we're printing out like an entire object so javascript is just telling us that we have an object here now if I wanted to I can access individual parts of this object so let's say that I wanted to access the name inside of this object what I can do is I can come down here and I can say person and then I can say dot and I can access that particular value by accessing it using the key so I can say name so remember the key for this name attribute was just name so if I say person dot name I'll be able to access the value of name so over here we'll just get Mike I could also say like person age and we'll get 23 I get access basically all of the attributes inside of this object I can also modify any of these attributes so I could come down here and I could say person dot name is equal to Jo and so now what this will do is it'll modify the name attribute inside of this person object and it'll change it to Jo so now if we access name you'll see that it's gonna be Jo instead of Mike so what we're actually able to update individual parts of that object just by accessing the specific attribute inside of the object so that's kind of a basic overview of objects and actually if you've been following along with this course up until now we've actually been using different objects so for example if I was to create a string so I'm just gonna get rid of this person object I'm gonna make a variable called phrase and I'll just set it equal to strings are cool all right so I have this string called phrase and it's just strings are cool this string is actually an object so I can actually access certain information certain attributes about this string so if I was to come down here obviously I can just like print out the string but I can also access specific attributes about this string so I can say phrase dot length and I'm accessing right now this length attribute and what this will do is it'll tell me like how long the string is so if you're using something like phrase this is actually a object in itself so there's a lot of these like little objects that are hidden throughout JavaScript that you might not realize our objects I want to show you guys one more thing that you can do which is you can actually put functions inside of these objects so we're back here on this person object so imagine I came down here a lot of times well people we'll do inside of these objects is they'll put different functions inside of here so for example I could create a function inside of this object and then I can call that function from outside of the object so I'm gonna type out something here we'll just call the function like print name and what this will do is it'll just like print the name out on to the screen in some sort of way so what I can say is function and I'm gonna do my open and close parenthesis and open the close curly brackets now inside here I can just write a normal function so maybe we would have this be like document dot write and we'll print out the name but maybe we'll put it like inside of a header one or something and this should be in fancies so now inside of here I'll print out the name of this inside of this object and this is another thing that you can do is you can actually access attributes from inside the same object so if I wanted to access the name what I could do is I could come down here and I'm just gonna put two plus signs and I can say this dot name and what this is going to do is it's gonna access the name from inside of this function so this keyword this is basically referring to the current object and so this dot name is gonna refer to this name up here so inside of this function I'm writing out to the screen this dot name so I'm writing out the name inside of this function so if I was to come down here we can just call this so I'll say person dot print name I can call this just like I would a normal function this will print out this name and actually over here I forgot to put a comma here and remember don't forget that so now when i refresh the page it's printing out the actual name from inside this object and I could also pass this function like information you can do everything that you would for a normal function but I just want to show you like this is how you would access a attribute inside of this current object so I could also access like is mail and this would print out is male value so that's kind of a little tip and don't be afraid to use functions inside of these objects that's like a really common use case is putting functions inside of here so that's the basics of using objects in JavaScript hopefully you guys learned a little something about this and you can go out and apply these objects to your JavaScript programming 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about how we can use objects to model real world entities in JavaScript so in JavaScript we have three basic data types we have strings numbers and boolean's and just using those three data types we can represent all sorts of information I can represent any number any like textual information or any true/false value but here's the problem in the real world when we're dealing with like real things a lot of stuff can't just be represented using a string or a number or a boolean for example let's say I wanted to represent like a movie inside of my java script well there's no movie data type right I wanted to use a movie and represent a movie inside my code but we don't have a datatype for that right all we have is strings integers and boolean but here's the thing we could actually represent all of the information about a movie using strings integers and boolean and we could sort of create our own little movie data type that is composed of strings integers and boolean's and that's basically an object an object allows us to use those three basic data types in order to represent more complex information so I could take a movie for example and represent a movie inside of my code using an object so I'm going to show you guys how we can do that today over here I'm on this website it's called IMDB and this is a stands for Internet Movie Database it's a really popular website that has information about movies and I'm over here on this page for the social network I thought this would be appropriate because it's kind of like a programming movie but you can see IMDB is actually representing this movie here on its page and IMDB is actually using an object now I'm not sure what programming language they're using but they're definitely using like an object in order to represent this so you can see we have like the movies title the release date of the movie the rating so it's pg-13 we have how long it was like two hours we have the genre so we have all this information about movie in addition we also have information about like who was in the movie so there's all these like actors you can see Jesse Eisenberg here we if we click on this it brings us to a page about Jesse Eisenberg so I am DB also has like an object for Jesse Eisenberg right they have his name where he was born and what day he was born they also have like a biography down here so IMDB is actually representing a movie and an actor on its website using objects I'm going to show you guys how we could create objects like that in order to represent like a movie of our own so why don't we do that let's create a movie object and we'll actually just create an object for the social network so I'm gonna come down here I'll just create a variable my movie and I'm gonna set it equal to an object so an object's just open and closed curly braces now inside of here we can actually put information about our movie so we can start to like model our movie inside of this object so I can say title and the title is the social network and we could say release year and I think it said 2010 so we can say 2010 and then it was duration so we can give duration I think it said 2 hours so we can make this like a decimal number and then there was also all those actors so we could say actors right but actors is actually a little bit more complex than these pieces of data so the title is just a string right the release year is just 2010 it's a you know it can be a string the duration can be a number but the actors are more complex remember we looked at that Jesse Eisenberg page and Jesse Eisenberg was actually an object in himself so what I want to do with these actors is create an array of actor objects so I'm gonna create objects for these different actors and I'll store them inside of this actors array so you'll see down here we'll make an entry into our actors array and I'm just gonna make an object so if I want to make an object in here I can just use open and close curly braces and now inside here we can start defining our jesse eisenberg object so i could say like named jesse eisenberg i'm pretty sure that's how you spell it and he also had some other information too like his birthday and his hometown so we can say his birthday and hometown so let's see what those are so it looks like his birthday is October 5th 1983 and he was born in New York City so birthday day we can make a date so we can say a new date and it's just gonna be October 5th 1983 and then his hometown was New York City so we could just say in New York New York so now we have a Jesse Eisenberg object right so inside of this actors array I can actually access this entire object just about Jesse Eisenberg I think there was also some other actors in that movie so we can create another object here let's see who else we can make an object for and I'll actually just copy this Jesse Eisenberg object and we'll make a different object for someone else so who else was in the social network looks like Rooney Mara was in the social network so we have this page for Rooney Mara and again we have her birthday so her birthday is April 17 1985 and she was born in Bedford New York so we can say April 17th 1985 and she was born in Bedford New York and then her name is Rooney Mara so now inside of this actors array we have two actors right we have Jesse Eisenberg which is just represented with this actor object and then we have Rooney Mara which is represented with this other actor object and I'm just storing both of those objects inside of this array and so now we've basically modeled our entire movie so we have the title of the movie there Elysia duration we have all the actors and then for each actor we have information so for this Jesse Eisenberg actor we have his name his birthday and his hometown so I can actually go ahead and print this object out onto the screen so we can just say document right and I think it was called my movie so when I print this out to the screen you'll see that we just get an object here and I can start accessing information so if I said my movie dot name will get the name of the movie or wait I call it title oops so we get the title of the movie we can also say like the interation we'll get that and we could access those different actors so I could say my movie dot actors and if I wanted to access an individual actor remember this is an array so I can just refer to it so we could say actor 0 dot name and now this should be Jesse Eisenberg so you see it is and we can get like his hometown and we can also do the same thing for Rooney Mara so you have movie Mara's hometown and then her name so what I really want to kind of like instill in you guys in this video is how we can model real world entities using these objects right so there's in other words there's no actor datatype right all we have is strings integers and boolean's for the most part right so there's no datatype for representing an actor inside of our program we can use an object to create an actor datatype and that data type is composed of strings numbers and boolean's and also we can use special objects like dates right so an object can also have other objects inside of it so we've messed we've essentially created like an actor datatype and we've created like a movie datatype up here so that's why objects are really useful because we can model more complex things inside of our programs 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using while loops in JavaScript now a while loop is basically a programming structure which we can use and it'll loop through a specified block of code until a certain condition is false so we can use while loops to like repeat certain code a bunch of times and maybe every time we go through the loop we'll do something a little bit different but we basically specify some code and we can run over that code a bunch of different times and using loops allows us to do a bunch of cool stuff inside of our JavaScript so I'm going to show you guys a very basic example of a while loop and then we'll look at how we can use while loops to create a little guessing game so down here I'm just gonna create a while loop and the first thing I want to do is create a variable so I'm just gonna say variable I is equal to 1 and this variable will basically sort of help us to illustrate what's going on inside of this loop and now I'm gonna create my while loop so I'm gonna say wild and I'm gonna make an open and close parenthesis and we'll do open and close curly brackets so this is like the basic structure for the wow loop now basically what's gonna happen is inside of these curly brackets I'm gonna place some code and that code is gonna get executed through it's just gonna get looped through a bunch of times and our program is just gonna loop through that code until a certain condition is false so up here in these parentheses we're gonna specify a condition and as long as that condition is true we're gonna keep iterating through that loop so generally what we're gonna do is each time we go through the loop we're going to like modify something and then eventually whatever we modify and we'll make this condition false so I'll show you guys I'm gonna make a condition it's just going to be I less than 10 so as long as this variable I has a value that's less than 10 you know let's make it less than or equal to 10 as long as this variable I has a value that's less than or equal to 10 we're gonna keep looping through the code that's inside of these curly brackets so I'm gonna write out some code and here and I'm just gonna say document up right and we're just gonna write out that variable I and then I also want to just include a break sign in here so it's a little bit easier to read and then after this what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna increment I so I'm going to add one to I so I'm gonna say I plus plus and we can use this plus plus to basically add one to I so plus plus is equivalent to saying I is equal to I plus one it's just sort of a shorthand so I'm gonna say I plus plus and now what's gonna happen is the code inside of here is gonna loop through until this condition is false so what you'll see is it's gonna loop through ten times and then I is gonna be equal to 11 so I will no longer be less than or equal to ten so I'm gonna show you guys over here on the browser when i refresh the page we're basically just printing out numbers one through ten so what's happening is let me make this a little bit bigger what's happening is we're starting this while loop and we're basically saying okay is this condition true is I less than or equal to ten and in our case is less than equal to ten so we go over here to the document and we write out one but then I increment one so one is now equal to two I come back up here and I check this condition again so after I loop through the code inside the while loop one time then I go back up to the top and I check the condition again so I'm saying okay I is now equal to two is 2 less than or equal to 10 two is less than equal to 10 so we print out two and then we increment I so I is now equal to three so what do we do we go back up to the top and we check that condition again so I say okay is 3 less than or equal to 10 yes it is we keep doing that until all the way until we get to I is equal to 10 right so now I has a value of 10 and we say okay as ah is 10 less than or equal to 10 yes so we print out 10 we increment I so I is now equal to 11 we check the condition again is 11 less than or equal to no go it's not so we just break out of the while loop and now we're done so if I was to for example get rid of this I plus plus what's gonna happen is this loop is just gonna go forever so we call that an infinite loop and this is something that you guys might encounter where this condition is never gonna be false because we're never incrementing I so it's just gonna basically just loop infinitely so you always want to make sure that when you're creating a loop that you make sure that the condition will eventually become false and you guys are gonna get into cases where you'll have infinite loops everyone does and actually in certain cases you want to have an infinite loop but for the most part you probably want to avoid it so that's the basics of using a while loop and I want to point out that if I was to come up here to this I variable and set it equal to 10 or actually I guess I would have to set it equal to 11 so now none of this code is going to execute because 11 is by default greater than or equal greater than 10 so this condition is going to be false right off the bat and we're not gonna do anything and this brings me to another point which is there's another type of while loop and instead of being called a while loop it's called a do-while loop and the only difference is that with a while loop the first thing that we do is check to see if this condition is true and so that's why this 11 wasn't able to get printed out because the first thing we did before we executed any code was check this condition right we immediately just checked it if it's not true we're not doing any code right but what you can do is you can switch this around so I can take this while condition I can put it down here at the bottom and I can say do up here and now all this code is going to get executed first and then we're gonna check the condition so now we'll actually be able to print out 11 because this is gonna happen first and before we check the condition so when i refresh the page you'll see we're able to print out 11 because in a do-while loop you're performing the operation inside the loop first and then you're checking this candy to see if you should loop again so do-while and while loops are both going to come in handy and in certain circumstances you're going to need two while loops and other circumstances you're gonna need while loops I would say by far while loops are more common than do-while loops but I just want to show you guys like how we can do stuff like that 


22 ------ NO TRANSCRIPT -----


in this tutorial on to talk to you about using for loops in JavaScript for loops are basically a special type of loop that we can use which will allow us to store an index counter as we go through our loop so every time I go through the loop I'll be able to figure out what iteration of the loop I'm currently on and a for loop is actually really similar to a while loop in fact a for loop is basically just a specialized version of a while loop but I want to show you kind of what that means so down here I have a while loop and this is one of those basic while loops you'll ever see I'm defining a variable I up here and I'm setting it equal to zero and I'm basically looping as long as I is less than 10 and what I'm doing is I'm just printing out I so I'm printing out I over here and then I'm incrementing I so if we come over to a web browser and i refresh the page you'll see we basically just get 0 through 9 printed out on the screen right I'm printing out 10 numbers 0 through 9 this is a very common use case when you're using loops a lot of times when you're writing a loop you're gonna want to have a variable similar to I basically a variable that's going to tell you what iteration of the loop you're currently on and generally we call this an indexing variable so that's why you'll see people use it I here because it stands for index and is special because every time we go through the loop it basically tells us what iteration we're on right so over here 0 1 2 3 it tells us like how many times we've completely gone through the loop like I said a lot of times in these loops you're gonna want to use an indexing variable like this and this is actually such a common situation when you're dealing with loops that there's a special kind of loop just for a situation like this so you'll notice when I do something like this with a while loop I have to declare this variable all the way out here and I have to always say I plus plus down here and I have to put this condition well we can use a for loop to essentially do exactly this without having to write all of this like extra syntax so a for loop takes this entire thing and cleans it up a lot and makes it a lot easier and more convenient for developers to use it but functionally a for-loop is doing exactly what this while loop is doing it's just a little bit easier so that's kind of the difference will first between four loops and while loops so why don't we take this while loop and will actually create a for loop just like it so I'm gonna do that right below here and I'm basically just gonna say four and I'm gonna have open and closed parentheses open closed curly brackets so so far it looks a lot like a while loop inside of here though I'm gonna put three different things so when I have this while loop I'm only putting one thing up here which is a condition when I have a for loop I'm gonna put three different things inside of these parentheses the first thing I'm gonna put is an indexing a variable so you notice up here in this while loop I have this variable I and one of the bad things about this setup with this while loop is that I have to like separately declare this variable outside of the while loop right so right above it I have to say variable I and then I can access this variable inside of the while loop in a for loop the first thing you're gonna put inside of this parentheses is this exact line so we're going to put variable I is equal to zero or you can really put you know you can put it equal to whatever you want or does have an equal to zero so the first thing inside of this for loop parentheses is going to be this indexing variable we're gonna create it or we're just gonna access it the second thing I want to put inside this parentheses after this semicolon I want to put the condition so the looping condition up here it says while I is less than ten so we want to keep looping as long as I is less than ten same thing down here for this for loop I can just copy this guy and we're gonna paste it right in here and so now this is basically gonna loop as long as I is less than 10 that's what this for loop is doing finally we want to put one more thing in this parentheses and this is gonna be the line of code that gets executed after the loop has finished in our case we're just incrementing this variable I so I'm gonna copy this I plus plus and I'll put this down here now notice that after the I plus plus we don't
semicolon so you need a semicolon after you initialize this variable you need a semicolon after you put down the looping condition and that's all you need so you can see this for loop is basically doing exactly what this while loop up here is doing it's just the syntax and the way that you write it is a lot simpler so I can take this variable I I can put it here I can take the condition put it here and I can take this I plus plus and put it here so it just saves me a lot of space and it makes it a lot simpler so now what I can do is I can just copy this line paste it down here into our for loop and you'll actually see that I'm just gonna get rid of the while loop this for loop is gonna do exactly what the while loop did so I'll refresh the page and you can see the code doesn't even change it's doing exactly what the while loop did so a for loop like I said you know if you could really take any for loop and just make it into a while loop but for loops are just more convenient and it's just a lot easier to manage now one of the things that a lot of people get confused about with these for loops is keeping track of all this stuff up here inside of the parentheses but just know that this variable I is our indexing variable and it doesn't have to be called I you could call it whatever you want in here we have our looping condition so we're gonna loop as long as I is less than 10 and then over here this is basically just a line of code that we want to execute after a loop iteration in our case it's just I plus plus we're incrementing this I variable and now we can use this document right we can print out I and it tells us what iteration of the loop were on so now that we have a for loop there's so many things that you can do with for loops and honestly I would say for loops are probably more common than while loops just because this is you know having to access like an indexing variable is just so common and it's such a common use case so I'm going to show you how we can use this for loop in order to loop through the elements inside of an array so this is a really popular use case for these for loops if I have an array over here so let's make an array I can just call it like friends and inside of this array we can just put names of like my friends or whatever so inside of here we could put a bunch of names we can say like Jim and it's a catheter so this friends array now has three name values now normally if I wanted to access one of those values in the array I can just do a document dot write and I'll just print one out so I could say friends and these square brackets 0 and now over here it'll print out this line so actually I'll do a break sign here as well so it's printing out that first friend if I was to say instead of 0 1 here I'm printing out the second fret etc so this is how I can access the elements inside the friends right and just to kind of reiterate the first element is always at index 0 so if I wanted I could actually print out all of the names inside of this friends array using this for loop so I can say there I is equal to 0 and I want to loop as long as there's another element inside of this array so instead of saying I is less than 10 we can say friends which is that array dot length and basically what this will do is it'll keep looping as long as I is less than the amount of friends inside of that array so this will ensure that we only loop through as many times as there are elements and that array and then we can keep I plus plus over here that's fine so down here instead of saying I instead of just printing out I what we want to do is we want to print out friends at the index of I so in the first iteration through this loop I is going to be equal to 0 and we'll be printing out that first friend we're putting out the first friend's name in the second iteration of this loop is going to be equal to 1 and we'll print out the second friend in the list so let's take a look at this I'm going to refresh the page and you'll see we're printing out all of the names of the people inside of this array so that's the basics of using a for loop in order to print out the elements an array and like I said that's a really common use case 




in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about creating a multiple-choice test in JavaScript so actually gonna write a program that will allow us to create a bunch of multiple-choice questions and then our program will take all those questions ask the user the questions and then record the score that the user gets this is gonna be awesome I just want to show you guys some stuff that I already have here the first thing I have is this variable called questions and this is a variable that I created before the video and basically it just stores all the questions that we want to use in our multiple-choice tests and I'll show you how I laid them out so in here I basically have three objects and this questions array is just a list of like question objects so I have this guy right here this guy right here and this one down here so all of these objects actually represent a multiple-choice question so over here you can see that I have the prompt and this is basically like the question itself so it's asking what color or apples are they red and green purple or orange and then over here I'm giving the answer so the answer in our case is a cuz apples are red and green and I have the same thing for another question so what color are bananas a teal B magenta or C yellow you guys gotta get the point like I'm creating an array of question objects and then what I'm gonna do is we'll write a program that will go through this array and it'll grab each question it'll ask the question get the answer and figure out you know what the user how these are did so did they get it right or wrong so if you want to follow along you can just create an array just like this with your own custom questions using this prompt name and the answer using this answer name I also have another variable called score and score is just set equal to zero here so that's gonna be like how many questions the user got right so let's go about asking these questions what I want to do is I basically want to loop through all the questions inside of that array and individually I want to ask each question I want to get the users response I want to figure out if that response is correct or not and then I'll tell them whether or not got the question right in order to do this our best bet is to use a for-loop so I'm gonna say for the vert I is equal to zero I so we want to loop while I is less than questions dot length so we want to loop for as many questions there are inside of that questions array and finally we just want to say I plus plus so we'll increment I so this is our basic like for loop structure now inside of this for loop we can actually start writing some code the first thing that we want to do is we want to ask the question to the user and then we want to be able to get their response so I'm gonna create a variable and we'll just call this response and I'm just gonna set it equal to window dot prompt and this will open up a window prompt where we can enter in some text and inside of this prompt this is going to be the text that the user is gonna see so this is basically like whatever I put inside these parentheses will be like what you're prompting the user to enter in and we already have that prompt attribute inside of our questions array which has all the questions so I can say questions and I want to access the specific question that we're looping through it so I'm gonna say I and then I can say dot prompt and what this will do is it will access that question prompt that we defined up there and that questions array so this looks pretty good to me now once we have the user's response we want to figure out if they got the answer right or not so I'm gonna make an if statement oops and in here we can basically just check to see if the response is equal to the answer to the question so the answer to the question is stored inside of that question object so I can say questions and I want to access the specific question that's getting looped through right now and we can say dot answer so if the response that they give is equal to the current question then we're gonna be good to go so if that is indeed the case then down here we can just increment the score so I can say score plus plus so if they got the tonight we'll give them an extra score and actually why don't we alert to them that they got the question right so say correct then we can say else so if they didn't get the question right we'll just yell at them so we'll give them an alert and it'll say wrong so that's basically all we need to ask the question and then over here were like grading the question so once we've done that loop then we want to just come down here and tell the user how they did so we can just alert how you got and we'll basically just alert how many questions they got right out of the total so we can say you got score plus out of and then over here we'll just type in how many questions that were so there were questions the length and number of questions so that'll give us our score so now let's come over here to our browser and see if we can play our game so I'm gonna refresh the page and here we are so we have this is displaying a little bit weird but we have what color our apples a red green be purple or C orange so let's go ahead and enter in the right answer which is gonna be a apples are indeed red and green and you'll see here we get that correct response so we got the question right now let's get the question wrong so what color are bananas teal magenta or yellow let's just say that they're B magenta so this should be wrong so now we should get a prompt saying that you're wrong right so it's gone ahead and graded the question and it's determined that we got the wrong answer last one is the last question and what color are strawberries strawberries are red so click B and then we'll hit enter now we should get a correct response and actually I got a wrong response here I must have but put this wrong in the questions array yeah so this is my bed over here in the questions array I had strawberries answer equal to a it should have been B that's my bad but nonetheless the program is still working as we wanted it to so I'll click OK and now this will give me the score that I got so it'll tell me you got one out of three so obviously the strawberries question was kind of rigged a little bit but basically what it did was it asked us all those questions and it kept track of how we were doing and then at the end it printed out how we did so we got 1 out of 3 questions correct so that's sort of how we can build our a little multiple-choice test and what's great about this is if I add in another question into this questions array or a loop over here will automatically be able to handle it so it doesn't matter how many questions are in that questions array the loop will just go through until we're out of questions to ask and it will keep track of the score no matter what 



In this tutorial ought to talk to you guys about creating a nested loop in JavaScript and then I also want to talk to you guys about creating a two-dimensional array so a nested loop is a situation where we have a loop inside of a loop it's kind of like loop inception and a two-dimensional array is when each element inside of our array is itself an array and believe it or not nested loops and two-dimensional arrays go really well together so I decided I'll just put them in the same video the first thing I want to show you is creating a nested loop so I'm gonna come down here and we basically are just creating a loop within a loop so I'm gonna save for there I is equal to 0 I is less than say 4 and this should be lower case and then it's gonna be I plus boss so we have our loop right here and now inside of this loop I actually want to create another loop so I'm gonna say for there now here's the thing we already used this variable I to keep track of the iterations for this first loop so we want to use a variable called J and generally it doesn't have to be called J but generally when people use nested loops like this they'll name it I and then J that's kind of like I don't know what most people do we can say I is less than 3 for example and then or whoops it should be J is less than 3 see these are already getting confusing then we can say J plus plus okay so inside of this for loop we have another for loop right so this is our highest level for loop and then we have this nested for loop inside of it so I want to show you guys like how this is gonna get executed and you know once you kind of know what's happening here and you kind of wrap your mind around it you're gonna be able to use nested loops no problem so I want to kind of try to push you in the right direction of understanding this so why don't we write out to the document so I say document dot write and I basically just want to print out the values for I and J so we'll just say I is equal to and then I don't say comma J is equal to and we'll just say J and then I also want to just print a new line here so we'll make a break tag cool so this is basically going to print out the values for I and J on every iteration of this loop and when we refresh the page you'll see what happened so over here on the page we have it's basically telling us like I is equal to 0 J is equal to 0 ok then I is still equal to 0 J is equal to 1 ok so I still equal to 0 then J is equal to 2 here's what's happening on the first iteration of the I loop on the first iteration of that top loop right we actually loop through the entirety of J so J is loop through all the way for one iteration of the I loop right so 0 0 0 this is all on the same loop number of I and J loop through 3 times which is as many times as it can loop through so for every iteration of I J will fully run in other words the loop inside of J is gonna get fully executed and that's kind of what's happening here so you can see like here's the first execution of these 3 here's the second execution of I these 3 and then we have the third and the fourth down there so that's kind of how nested loops are gonna work is that every time we go through one iteration of this top loop we're going to go through every iteration of this bottom loop and there's a lot of situations where that's going to come in handy and we can you know take advantage of something like this so now I want to introduce a topic which is two-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional arrays and nested loops actually go really well together so I'm gonna show you how we can use them together first order of business though is using this two-dimensional array so I'm actually gonna get rid of this guy down here so we're not printing anything and I want to create a two-dimensional array so I'm gonna say they're number grid we're gonna create like a grid of numbers and we'll set this equal to an array so this is just gonna be a normal array but here's the thing every element inside this array is gonna be an array in itself so the first element of the ray is gonna be an array the second element is gonna be array etc so I'll create the first element and we'll just create an array and I'm gonna give it some numbers so 1 2 3 then we'll create another element inside of the number grid array which is going to be an array so we'll say 4 5 6 and finally we'll just make another one 7 8 9 and actually why don't we make one more just to kind of drive the point home here it'll just be 0 so you'll notice that this array down here has a different number of elements than all of these arrays and that's kind of something that you can do when we're using these nested loops so if I wanted to access individual elements inside of this number grid I can do that by specifying the row that they're in and specifying the column that they're in so just for a refresher usually like horizontal is gonna be rows and vertical is gonna be columns so this would be like Row 1 or I guess if we're talking about arrays this would be row 0 this would be Row 1 this would be Row 2 etc and then this would be column 1 this would be column 2 and this would be column 3 or column 0 1 & 2 because with arrays you always start with 0 so let's see if we can print out some of these elements document right and why don't we print out this first element right here so we're out this one the way that I can access this is by saying number grid and I actually want to give this a row and I want to give it a column so the first thing I'm gonna do is give it a row so that one is it rows 0 so I'm gonna say 0 and then we want to specify what column it's at in that row so it's it column 0 right so this one is at position 0 0 so let's save this and we'll come over here and it should print out and actually I think I have a typo here yeah there should be document my bad so over here now we'll be printing out one so we're accessing the element at position 0 0 let's say I wanted to print out this 9 right this is in column or this is in row 0 1 2 so it's in Row 2 and it's in column two as well so it's like all the way at the bottom right and so now we'll be able to print out that nine let's say we wanted to put out this five which is right in the middle here that's gonna be in row 1 column 1 so that's basically how we can access any of these elements inside of these arrays is we can use these two square brackets here to specify the row and then specify the column so now let's see how we can use this with our nested loop basically we can use this nested loop in order to write out the contents of the array so all I want to do here is just spit out the contents of this array easy enough the first thing we need to do is modify some of these values right so up here we're saying I less than 4 but really what we want this to be is I less than the number of rows inside of our two-dimensional array so what I can say here is number grid length and this is going to give us the number of rows inside of this length in other words or the number of rows inside of the number good it's going to give us you know 1 2 3 4 because we have 4 rows and the next thing we want to do is change the number down here so instead of being number grid length we want it to be number grid I dot length so here we're referring to a specific row inside of the number grid and we're getting the length of that array so hopefully this makes sense like why we're using these different attributes now once we've done that all we have to do is just print out the contents of the array so I'm just gonna paste this guy that I got from up there and instead of accessing number grid 1 1 we're gonna want to access number grid I and number grid J and this will basically give us every single element inside of this array and then after this nested for loop I'm just gonna create a new line because this will mean we moving on to another row so let's do that now when i refresh the page you'll see that the contents of our arrayed prints out so we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 what's cool is even though this 0 array down here was a different length than the other ones our program doesn't care it basically is just getting the length dynamically and it's able to loop through as many elements as it needs so let's step through this one more time you're see guys understanding exactly what's happening down here we're saying for their eyes equal to 0 and we want to loop through this top loop for as many rows as there are in our 2d array and we can get the rows by just saying number grid length right this is just the number of entries inside of the array down here in our nested loop for each row inside of our numbered grid inside of our two-dimensional array we want to loop through all the elements inside of it so each row is itself an array so we can say number grid I accessing the specific row in the two-dimensional array and then get the length of it so we want to loop through all the elements then down here we're just printing out each individual element so we're printing out I J and then we get our result over here so that's the basics of nested loops and two-dimensional arrays now obviously there's other uses for nested loops than just for looping through 2d arrays but this is kinda like the classic example you'll always see these like talked together because they go together so well 



in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about using the for each loop in JavaScript now a for each loop is basically a special type of for loop that we can use with arrays and JavaScript to loop through the elements inside of those arrays so normally if we were just gonna loop through the elements inside of an array we could use a for loop so down here I just have this for loop and you can see it basically just says for there I is equal to 0 I is less than friends dot length I plus plus and then up here I have this friends array and it has 3 elements inside of it with just different names and down here I'm just writing out document out write friends and I'm passing in this eye as the index so over here on the website you'll see I'm printing out all of the elements inside of this array here's the thing though looping through the elements in an array is such a common task in JavaScript that there's actually a special function that we can use call it a for each and basically what it'll allow us to do is loop through all the elements inside of an array really easy so instead of having to write out this whole for loop we can basically just write a for each loop and it'll make it a lot easier to loop through the elements in the array so let's create a for each loop the first thing we want to do is say friends and I just want to say the name of the array that I want to loop through and then I'm gonna say dot for each and this is actually a function that we can call so I'm gonna call it just like I would call a normal function with an open and closed parentheses now inside of here I want to put another function and this is basically a function that's gonna get called for every single element inside of the array so let me say that again for every single element in this friend's array we're gonna call the function that I put inside of these parentheses and I'm just gonna create a function inside of here so we can just say function and I don't need to give this a name I can just make an open or close parenthesis and an open curly braket so this function that we write in here and all the code that we put inside of these curly brackets is gonna get executed for every single element in the array so I'm just gonna click enter here and now we can write any code in here that we want to write for each element the array so I could just say like document right and basically I can just print out like element so now over here and actually let me put a break in here so now over here on my web browser when I run this program you'll see it prints out element three times so for every single element inside of this an array it's gonna perform this function down here so it's going to basically just print out element onto the screen and so that's really cool right I can do something for every element in the array but what if I want to access the element in the array that I'm currently looping through right if you're looping through the elements in the array chances are you're gonna want to do something with them like print them out or modify them or you know do something else with them and in order to get access to the individual element that we're currently looping through I can actually pass a parameter into this function so over here I can say element and then down here I can actually print out the element inside of the array by accessing that parameter so I have element up here and this is basically gonna pass into this function the current element that we're looping through then down here we can access it so I'm gonna run this program and now you'll see instead of just printing out element we're printing out the individual elements inside of the array so I could really call this whatever I want it doesn't have to be called element you can name it something else but elements usually like a good name just because that's exactly what it is it's the element inside it here but if I wanted for example I'm looping through an array of friends so it might be better for me to call this friend and basically what this is saying is for each friend inside of the friends array I want to access the individual friend so sometimes it's better to name these it's like that so that's the basics of a for each loop and these can be really powerful so over here I have another little variable setup and this is actually an array of objects so if I expand this here you'll see that we have this big array and the first element in the array is an object and the second element in the array is an object and these are both books so this is an array of books you can see over here we have this Harry Potter book and the authors JK Rowling and the pages are 300 and then we have green eggs and ham authors dr. Seuss and there's 25 pages so I basically have an array of different books and I could use this for each function to easily loop through all those books so we could say set of friends books and we can say for each book I want to do something so I could actually print out like different attributes of the book so I could say like book dot author and for each of the books this is gonna print out the author of the book so we get JK Rowling we get dr. Seuss I can also print out like another attribute so we could say like book dot title and actually we can put another break sign here so now I'll actually be printing out information for both of these books so we have Harry Potter the author JK Rowling green eggs and ham the authors dr. Seuss so you know basically these for each loops do exactly what a normal four loop would do but they just make it a lot easier so I would definitely recommend using these whenever you're trying to loop through the elements in an array it's a lot simpler and it's just a lot cleaner so it's a lot easier to kind of visualize what's going on 



in this tutorial I'm gonna talk to you about timing in JavaScript now in JavaScript you can actually use specific timing functions which will allow you to do certain things after certain time intervals so for example I could click a button on a screen and then three seconds later a message would pop up or I could have a certain JavaScript function run every five seconds in my app timing can be really useful and in this tutorial I'm just going to show you guys the basics so over here on my HTML file I have a pretty basic setup I just have a button down here and it says click mean and what I want to do is I want to be able to click this button and then like four or five seconds later I want to have an alert pop up on the screen and we can use a JavaScript timing function to do that so the first thing we want to do is attach an event handler onto this button so basically I want to be able to do something when someone clicks this button so I can say on click is equal to and inside of these quotation marks I can basically put whatever I want to do when the button gets clicked so when I click that button the code inside of these quotation marks is going to get executed what we can do is we can call a special JavaScript timing function called set timeout and this is a really cool function because what it'll do is it'll basically set a timer for us and we can specify how long we want that timer to be and then when the timer runs out it'll execute a JavaScript function so inside of this set timeout I need to pass it two parameters the first is going to be the name of a function that I want to execute at the end of the time interval so I can just say any function let's say we'll make a function called say hi and whenever you put a function inside of here you just want to include the function name you don't want to use open and closed parentheses so just put the name and then we're gonna pass in a second parameter and this is going to be a duration so when we're using this timeout function all durations are specified in middle seconds so in here you can put however many milliseconds you want the timer to wait so if I put a thousand for example that's gonna be equivalent to one second if I put three thousand that's gonna be equivalent to three seconds so I like three seconds I think this looks good so we have everything set up on this button right when I click the button it's gonna call this set timeout function the set timeout function is gonna wait three seconds and then it's going to call this say hi function so our next order of business is to create that say hi function so over here I'm just gonna make that function now say function and it'll just be called say hi and all we're gonna do here is just alert something to the screen will just say hi so there's a really no the world's simplest function but what should happen now is I should be able to click this button and then three seconds later this say hi function will get executed so I'm gonna come over here refresh the page I'll click the button and one two three three seconds later this hi message pops up so it's just saying hi and what we didn't work right so we use that set timeout method and three seconds later after we click the button we're able to see the alert message pop up so it's working out pretty well and that's the basics of using that set timeout function you can use that set timeout function you can specify a time and then after that time is complete you'll execute a function there's a lot of different ways that this can be useful I want to show you a couple other functions that we can use and in addition to set timeout there's also another one called set interval so it's very similar to set timeout it's just called set interval and we can use set interval and this function this say hi function will get executed at an interval so every three seconds this say hi function will get executed so actually I'm gonna change this to two seconds just so we don't have to wait as long so now what should happen is when I click the button that alert will start showing up every two seconds so I'm gonna click this button I'll wait two seconds we get the alert and now two seconds after that we're gonna get another and so this is just gonna keep happening infinitely no matter what I do and that's kind of the basics of using that interval so you can basically execute a function at specific intervals 


in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about local storage and JavaScript a local storage is basically a mini database where we can store information from our JavaScript files and then when the user refreshes the page or exits out of their web browser and they come back to our website we'll actually be able to store information so we can give them the same information as last time so for example I could have somebody enter their name into this text box I could have them click Save then they could shut down their browser come back to our website and that name value would still be there so local storage can be pretty useful to use in your websites and like I said it basically just acts as a mini database so here we're gonna create a little app where these are enters in their name they click Save and then the name gets saved in local storage so over here on my HTML you see I just have an input here with the ID of text box and a button with the ID of BTN so I'm gonna go ahead and wire these things up so that when I click this button the text inside of the text box gets saved so I'm gonna create a variable we'll just call it text box and I'm just gonna grab the element off the page so I'll say document dot get element by ID and we're just gonna grab that text box and I also want to do the same thing for the button so we'll make a variable called button and I'll just be document get on by ID and the idea was BTN so now we have this textbox variable and this button variable what I want to do is I want to add an event listener onto the button so I basically want to be able to monitor when the button gets clicked so I can say button dot add event listener and inside of this event listener we're gonna give it two values so the first thing we're gonna give it is an event so I can just say like on or actually I can just say click and over here we want to give this a function so I'm gonna create a function and now inside of this function we can it's acute any code when the button gets clicked so let's just make sure it works I'll just put an alert in here so now when I click the button we get this alert so everything's wired up and working so what I want to do is I want to grab the text from inside of the text box and I want to store it inside of the local storage on our website and the way that we can store something in local storage is we can just say local storage and now we can basically just say whatever attribute we want so I could say local storage dot name and I can set this equal to the text that's inside of that text box so I can just say text box value and here's the thing you can really put anything here this doesn't have to be name this is just what I want to give to local stores so I want to store the text box value in a variable called name inside of local storage but you could put anything here it doesn't have to be name so now what should happen is when I click the button it should save the text box value in local storage so I also just want to make sure this is happening so actually I'm just gonna write this out and we'll be able to see what the value is so we can write out local storage dot name and that's also how you access it so over here on our web browser I'll refresh the page and you can see a value shows up down here so I had previously stored a value inside of my local storage with the name dog but I could update that so if I come over here to this text box I can type something in like I could type my name in I'll click Save and now my name is saved to local storage so if i refresh the page you'll see that instead of saying dog it says Mike so whatever I put in here I gotta put draf in here I'll save it now when I update the page you'll notice that that value gets saved so I can also close the browser and that value would persist across the browser so that's the basics of using local storage you know essentially you can store anything you want inside of local storage and it should be able to persist across browser sessions so that's the basics of using local storage in scripts
